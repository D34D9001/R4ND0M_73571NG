Charming, romantic, and full of creative energy, people who were born with a 3 Life Path number know how to embrace life! They tend to see the world through rose-colored lenses where everything looks like an opportunity and the chances for expression and enjoyment are endless.

But while Life Path 3 people are great at attracting others, forming real, deep bonds is the difficult part. They want to keep things fun and new but feel they have to give that up if they make themselves vulnerable to intimacy. Those with this Life Path live in the moment, so the idea of committing to anything long-term can be a daunting one.

A person with this Life Path number is very fun to be around, but could also benefit from embracing a deeper, more spiritual side of life. While those with a 3 Life Path truly enjoy who they are and what they do, there's a more meaningful level of experience and emotion that people with this Life Path may never even know exists. It's an untapped well of ideas to explore and engage with if they will muster up the courage to go to a deeper, more spiritual level.

Though people born with a Life Path number 3 will be dealt both joy and hardship just like the rest of us, their unique way of thinking and dedication to happiness allow them to always see the silver lining. The power of positivity goes a long way for people with this Life Path.

With a wide range of knowledge, Life Path number 4 people are natural teachers. They are confident in what they know and speak with such clarity and authority that others accept what they say. They need to remember, though, that they are also students and that there is always, always more to learn.

People with a 5 Life Path number are on a lifelong adventure. They are ready for anything and want to soak up every experience this world has to offer. Life Path number 5 people tend to learn by living and don't allow themselves to get stuck in any situation that has outworn its interest. The moment things start to get humdrum, a person with this Life Path will move on to something more fascinating.

Routine is unbearable to people with a Life Path 5, so typical 9-5 jobs are not appealing to them. Though they will change their career path many times throughout life, positions that allow them the freedom to make their own decisions will be the most satisfying. And whether on the job or off, making time for travel will be key to feeling fulfilled for those with this Life Path.

Meeting new people is no problem for a person with this Life Path number -- they are very social creatures by nature and enjoy engaging with others. What is more difficult for these people is maintaining friendships and romantic relationships beyond the initial stages. They have a tendency to lose interest and bow out before there's a chance to make a deeper connection.

However, their fickle and flighty nature makes it tough to ever really get close.

People born with a Life Path 6 embrace their emotions and lead with their heart. They give off a warm and inviting energy that others want to be around. They enjoy many rich relationships throughout their life, both romantic and friendly. Whether these Life Path people encounter someone who is just like them or someone who is entirely different, they will treat them the same: with kindness, respect, and support. Some Life Path numbers only see black and white, but the Life Path number 6 can see and accept the infinite shades of grey between.

With a natural ability to connect with others and offer aid and advice, 6 people do well as professional counselors, mentors, and teachers.

The love life of a person born with a 6 Life Path number is deep and romantic. They are refreshing to partners who may be used to lovers who don't relate as well to their feelings. Though not every relationship can be a lifelong one, 6 Life Path people are devoted to love and harmony and committed to making things last. What these people need to remember, however, is that they are also individuals. It may be noble to sacrifice oneself to love, but it's not healthy. People with a Life Path number 6 must remember to direct the same attention they give others onto themselves. Only then will they feel truly, universally balanced.

People born with a Life Path 7 are eternal students of the universe. They are introspective individuals with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and they enjoy looking into the inner workings of things. Someone with this Life Path is a true thinker who lets their mind lead the way. Pretty much from the moment of birth, they are able to skillfully combine the exacting side of their brain with their divine intuitive side to learn about, process, and make sense of life itself.

The 7 Life Path in Numerology is smart in a knowledgeable way, yet wise in a spiritual way. People with this Life Path number enjoy gaining book smarts, but they are also more connected to their higher self than most and have great access to this inner wisdom. While they are spiritual creatures, though, Life Path 7 people don't tend to be the religious type. Strict doctrines that don't make room for new information are a turn-off to these inquisitive folk.

Similar to The Hermit in a Tarot deck, people born with a Life Path number 7 often go it alone. They like the freedom of not having to explain themselves and enjoy the control and possibility of solitude. Their social circle tends to be a small one made up of people with like-minded interests. They may come across to the world as a bit awkward in groups or when meeting new people. Romantically, people with this Life Path may find it hard to connect on an emotional level with others. They love the part of getting to know someone, asking questions and exchanging answers, but often lack the interest or ability to build a heartfelt bond.

Professions that require research and problem-solving skills are a perfect fit for those with a Life Path 7. If given a quiet space to think and work, they'll dive deeper than anyone into a problem and come out with the most valuable and viable solution. Their analytical powers are off the charts and these skills make them an asset to any project or team.

The Life Path number 8 personality is one of hard work and hard lessons. People born with this Life Path number get their worth from accomplishing great things -- the bigger the goal, the more satisfying it feels when they achieve it. Money and material goods are important to them because they are rewards and reminders of all the effort put in. People with this Life Path direct all their energy into creating a life of success and abundance.

Dealing with people in positions of authority is often tough for people born with an 8 Life Path number. Because they are leaders themselves and are supremely confident in their abilities, they don't take kindly to being told what to do -- especially if it goes against what they would choose to do. Life Path 8 people, too, can also come across as authoritative and must learn that all relationships are about harmony.

With all the work these Life path people put into reaching their goals and feeling accomplished, they would be wise to pay attention to their health. Stress is the all-too-familiar enemy of those born with the 8 Life Path number and, if allowed, it will slow down or deter these people on their path to reaching their goals. Making time for meditation, friendship, and enjoyable pursuits helps to bring things back into balance. Health is wealth, so maintaining a healthy lifestyle should be a top priority.

When it comes to relationships, people with an 8 Life Path will put in the same work and dedication that they put into everything else. They do well in long-term situations, but these relationships may look more like business arrangements than passionate love affairs. Life Path number 8 people see themselves as providers and willingly take on the role of supporting a partner or family. They know they are self-sufficient, but when they see that they are prosperous enough to also provide for loved ones, to them, that's proof of success.

The knowledge they have gained can be incredibly valuable to others on their own journeys.

A person who is born with a Life Path 9 tends to be spiritual and connects deeply with religion. Whether it stems from a need for strength during times of struggle or a natural desire to relate to something greater than themselves, Life Path number 9 people often seek courage and meaning from a higher source. Intuitions and gut reactions may even outweigh logic. This connection to the divine gives these people a safety net of confidence as they continue to make their way through life's good times and bad.

People with a Life Path 9 may feel a great devotion to their fellow man. They are humanitarians by nature and use their big hearts to support those who have been made to feel inequal or unworthy. But because 9 Life Path people have become so accustomed to enduring their own challenges, others may not notice when they are in need and, unfortunately, they have a very difficult time asking for help. People with this Life Path number must realize that assistance is part of a cycle of give and take, and with as much support as they give, it's their karmic responsibility to receive support in return.""",

You may even find it difficult to cooperate with others, preferring to do things your way rather than listening to anyone else's opinions.

Your Soul Urge is to be the driving force in life.


You have a deep belief that what you feel, say and do has great value in the world (and you’re right).

You desire to be heard, and for others to follow your lead. You trust your own instincts, often above the views and perspectives of others, and have the makings of a great leader and a pioneer for change.

You may have issues with authority throughout your life, not least because your self-assuredness often means that others look to you for guidance and direction, regardless of the position you take.

You are committed and loyal, however, your dominant nature means others are easily silenced in your presence, and you may not even notice the hurt feelings of those you leave in your wake. You must be careful that your confidence isn’t confused with arrogance, and your desire for progress doesn’t create needless competition.

Your Soul Urge is to be needed, admired and loved by all.

You are motivated by relationships and have a deep need to connect with others. You are sensitive and tactful and always striving to ensure harmony, balance, and cooperation prevail wherever you are.

You may have issues with self-trust throughout your life, not because you don’t value yourself, but because you always need someone else’s opinion or perspective to measure, contrast or connect to your own. Without an external point of reference, you can feel lost, or even lonely.


Your strong, often intuitive connection to others means that you’re a natural team player and a valuable contributor to the whole. But you must ensure that your kindness and sensitivity doesn’t leave you too open or vulnerable. Strong emotional boundaries will ensure you’re not taken advantage of in life.

You’re a performer at heart and love nothing more than an adoring audience. This means you have the potential to achieve great fame and recognition in your life, especially within the Arts.

You’re likely to be disorganized and even scattered in your approach to life. This can make you appear uncommitted or disloyal, so it’s vital for you to learn to channel and devote your creativity to fewer, larger projects as you grow.

Your Soul Urge is to find beauty, order and stability in the chaos of life.

You find a Zen-like satisfaction in performing the simplest repetitive, domestic or practical chores as you feel in most alignment with your essence when restoring harmony to unbalanced situations. You are a creator of systems and love to make plans and organize the world around you. Others feel an innate sense of security and stability when near you, and you’re often called upon for advice and counsel.

It’s likely that you fear change or uncertainty, which means you may miss out on opportunities to grow. It’s important that you give yourself enough space for spontaneous actions, and frequently do things that take you out of your comfort zone.


You’re incredibly loyal, patient and generous. But your straight-talking attitude can sometimes be received as a little harsh or unkind (though never intentional) so developing greater skills of empathy and tact, would likely serve you well.

Your Soul Urge is to experience as much variety as you can.


You have an inquisitive mind and a thirst for adventure that is only satisfied when you’re on a quest of discovery. Travel is your passion, and you feel at your most alive when you’re on the open road, meeting new people and experiencing new things. This means that you may quickly become jaded or restless and struggle with commitment in ordinary life. And if you feel too hemmed in, either by a situation or a partner, then you’ll quickly find ways to rebel.

Your enthusiasm inspires others and you easily make friends. Unfortunately, maintaining these relationships can be much harder for you, as once the initial spark of excitement has worn off you’re often resistant to opening up to others in deeper ways.

You have an innate sense of trust that the Universe will look after you, but don’t easily share this trust with the people in your life, so learning to be vulnerable with others is a great challenge, but one which will ultimately bring you much strength and fulfillment.

Your Soul Urge is to nurture and care for others.

You love people and have a true gift for creating the right conditions for others to flourish and reach their highest potentials. You have a deep need to provide for other people’s needs and an intuitive sense of what those needs are.

You are happiest when you can see the positive results of your influence unfolding, and witness the people around you thriving and happy. But this selfless approach to life can often lead to you neglecting your own needs, so you must ensure your energy does not become depleted and you regularly care for yourself, as much as for others.


You may have perfectionist tendencies, leading to very high expectations of yourself and of others which means it can be very difficult for you or anybody else to reach the lofty goals you set. This can lead to disappointment and resentment, so you must learn to let go, or true fulfillment and happiness will always be elusive.

Your Soul Urge is to discover meaning in the world around you.


You’re a natural seeker of knowledge, on an endless quest to find out the “hows” and “whys” of life. Whether in scientific, historical, literary or mystical realms, you have a deep yearning to always understand more.

Because of your questioning nature, you can often feel as though you don’t quite belong in the world. That other are able to simply accept things at face value is a mystery to you, so it’s likely that you instinctively separate yourself from them and may be perceived as an outsider.

In truth, you are unique, and your perspectives are of great value to the world. Discovering healthy expressions and outlets for your thoughts and theories is vital if you are to fulfill your potential, and gain the trust of your peers.

You must also work to develop self-trust, as however much groundwork and research you do, ultimately, your truth will be found within.

Your Soul Urge is to find power, status, and prosperity.

You understand commerce, trade, and industry and want it to benefit those you love.

You are confident, ambitious and have high levels of stamina. Your strong sense of purpose may come across as domineering to others, but really you just want to achieve the success that you work so hard for!


Your challenge is not to be overcome by material gains, but to go the extra mile and use the money and power that you so naturally magnetize, for the greater good. You are a natural leader, so ensure that you lead by example and act with integrity at all times.

You have visionary perspectives and are unwaveringly positive. You have the uncanny ability to always see (and believe) in the best possible outcome in any situation.

You desire to impart your wisdom, experience, and insight to others, but must be careful that your well-wishes don’t come across as overbearing. Often regarded as someone who has all the answers (and willingly offers them) can mean that others come to resent and rebel against your advice. Or alternatively, they resist thinking for themselves when they’re around you, so you must be very careful that your desire to help doesn’t interfere with others’ need to find their own way through life, and crucially, make their own mistakes.

It is also important for you to learn the art of fair exchange. You have such a generous spirit that you can easily give, give and give without receiving anything in return. Your idealistic nature would love to believe you are setting an example, but in reality, you could be creating an unhealthy imbalance of energy.

You are creative and have a calming influence on others. In fact, it’s likely that other people are instinctively drawn to you, sensing your highly healing frequencies by simply being in your presence.

Just like the Soul Urge 4, others feel an innate sense of security and stability when near you, so you inspire a great deal of confidence in them. As such, you will make a great leader, manager, and organizer of people. In fact, you will begin to realize your true calling only when you begin to see your grandest visions materializing with the help of others, whom you have carefully directed.

You must be sure that you follow your souls calling in life, and do not become lethargic and too safely confined in your comfort zone. Soul Urge 22s are destined for great things, but courage and self-belief must come first, lest their talents are frittered away.

You’re being called upon to work with giving and contributing, without thought of personal reward. Letting go of “self” in order to learn to be of service to others is a huge lesson for this single-digit.
In your younger years, you may have been caring and attentive to others’ needs, and this will carry over in your later life. You will have the added peace and maturity not to live with jealousy and fears. The things that can give you comfort in your later years are art and travel, and you will still remain interested in humanitarian concerns.

The 0 Challenge takes on the charasterics of a 9, because it is, in a peculiar way, it's replacement.

Growth is allowed to take place without one particularly serious obstacle. This does not mean that there will not be obstacles on your path, but there is no single and consistent challenge during this period.

You are being challenged to stay faithful and focused on your highest ideals. You will often find yourself in a situation where you have an opportunity to be of help to people at large; people you never met and perhaps live in other countries. The 9 (here substituted with the 0) reflects global awareness, empathy, and a desire to dedicate time to helping humanity.

In order to overcome this Challenge, it is necessary that you recognize those opportunities and take full advantage of them. Helping others will benefit no one as much as it will benefit you.

It is not uncommon for people with a 0 Challenge to find career opportunities in diplomacy, law enforcement, and legal fields, and in those capacities they are often considered protectors of the less fortunate.

You must learn to be independent. You will be forced to stand up for yourself and your rights. You will be faced with situations in which you will have to choose between standing up for what you think is right versus giving in to another person's demands. You will have to struggle to strengthen and know your own will power.

You will have to learn to be firm and trust your judgment. Don't run with the crowd, be an individual. This whole lesson represents the frontiers of your consciousness. Therefore, you will have to experience much trial and error, sometimes exploding with bursts of aggression, other times being intimidated and letting frustration and anger build within you until you are ready to act on your deepest instincts.

You will learn your own set of values; you will develop into an individual with original and innovative ideas.

If you have 1s in your core numbers or in your Hidden Passion this challenge will not be as difficult to learn, nor as strongly felt.

"2": """
You are overly sensitive and too aware of other peoples' expectations. You suppress yourself to avoid feeling conspicuous. You can be overwhelmed by self-consciousness. You fear gossip about you. As a result, you become inhibited. All of this results in a suppression of your own individuality and uniqueness. You yearn to blend into the crowd.

You let your own feelings and emotions play too big a role. Your hypersensitivity causes fear, timidity and lack of self-confidence. And you experience unnecessary fear and emotional turmoil. Little things seem disproportionately difficult to overcome and sometimes have a paralyzing effect. Jealousy can cause much pain and misunderstanding. These negative aspects of the numerology challenge actually spring in part from positive characteristics you possess, especially your acute awareness and intuition. You are an antennae for other peoples feelings; you know before a word is spoken how they feel.

You lack the inner strength to maintain your own center, and try to conform to the prevailing emotional atmosphere.

This challenge makes you understanding and compassionate; you have an enormous empathy for the inner turmoil of others and can do much good for people with emotional problems.

You are your own worst critic. You suppress your individuality and creativity. Each time you want to make an impression, you doubt yourself beforehand, and criticize yourself ruthlessly afterward. Your criticism of yourself is far more severe than anyone else's. As a result, you tend to play it safe by staying on the surface, indulging in superficialities. You rarely express what goes on deep inside of you; instead, you cover up your feelings with humor or perfunctory remarks.

You often feel alone and lonely. Your fear of social interaction causes you to strain conversation by making too many jokes and forced joviality. It may help you to find a creative outlet for your imagination, possibly through writing, painting, singing or dance.

At the bottom of this numerology challenge is an effort to bring out your true self. You will learn to truly value your own creative talents above anyone else's judgments. This must be viewed as a process of individuation, in which you become a whole human being, independent and free of the need to conform to others.

You have to learn to be aware of the details. Keep your environment clean and orderly. Be efficient. You have the ability to be practical and organized but you must learn their value. This will cause you to incorporate them into your daily life and give you the basis for success.

This is the challenge of building a lasting foundation for your life. You will need perseverance and repeated effort. Get-rich-quick schemes will likely backfire; persistent effort is the key to your future happiness.

You are in danger of becoming a rolling stone. Your desire to experience and enjoy life can overwhelm every other priority you have. Your need for freedom dominates you. You want to try everything and go everywhere.

You must guard against overindulgence - and even dependence upon - alcohol, food, drugs, and sex.

You must work at establishing and maintaining long- lasting relationships. Be tolerant and understanding. This will enable you to have people in your life who are more than mere company. You need to discipline your urge to change every situation that does not immediately suit you. Stick with projects, maintain your friendships, don't abandon people or situations the minute they become the slightest bit difficult.

If few fives are in the chart you have a fear of change and can not let go of people and situations. This holds you in the past, restricting your growth. Learn to take prudent risks and be more adventurous.

Your 6 Challenge deals with distorted idealism. Your ideals are unrealistically high, making life difficult for you and others. You have a hard time being satisfied with anything you do, or with what others do for you. You lack gratitude. This prevents you from seeing the beauty in your life. You may also suffer from rigid thinking, which keeps you from having a clear perspective that would otherwise awaken you to the many good things you have received.

At bottom, this challenge is about having blinders on. You are unable to see a broader view, which makes you think you have all the answers. This keeps away information and perspectives that would be helpful to you.

Your desire to be of service to others is sincere. However, it may be blocking you from seeing the necessity of working on your own inner development. You can be domineering and righteous, often telling others what is right and what is wrong. You often feel a lack of appreciation from others.

There is an opportunity to be of service, to teach and heal, but you will have to achieve a balanced perspective between your idealism and your resistance to personal transformation.

You are highly skeptical of anything that cannot be proven to you. You are particularly doubtful of anything having to do with spiritual matters. It is, therefore, difficult for you to find a personal philosophy that would give you peace of mind and insight into the purpose of your life. You repress many of your natural inclinations because they do not fit into your intellectual or rational thinking. You are in need of the part of your being that you are now repressing: the child within.

All the characteristics that have to do with the irrational and holistic side of life - spirit, humor, playfulness, and intuition - are being shut out. Your challenge is to find some philosophy and, ideally, a community that will give you additional perspectives, and force you to bring out the many other characteristics that are a fundamental part of you. Otherwise, you risk loneliness and isolation.

You have to learn faith. When you consider that most of life is made up of the invisible world - thoughts, emotions, insight, and love - you can begin to appreciate that only a small part of life is within the domain of your senses.

You may have too much pride. You may experience a deep and humbling transformation that will set free the inner being you are keeping trapped within you.

Some people with a 7 Challenge, especially if it appears as the Third or Main Challenge in their numerology chart, will eventually turn 180 degrees and become emerged in the search for spiritual clarity. A number of Saints and Holy Men or Women are found to have a 7 Main Challenge.

"8": """
You risk making money and power the main priority in your life. Your desire for financial wealth threatens to obscure your other human characteristics and spiritual well being.

This Challenge causes financial concerns to overwhelm all other needs, and influences everything you do. You risk the fate of Midas, turning everything into gold, yet isolating yourself from other parts of life.

For many with this challenge, there is a danger of becoming so obsessed with materialism that they may be tempted to ruthless and unscrupulous business practices, possibly crossing the borders of the law and causing themselves and others much misery.
You are facing a very real spiritual test in which you must realize that"Man does not live by bread alone." If you overcome this hurdle, you will achieve real spiritual and material balance, and can make yourself a powerful river, bringing an inexhaustible supply of nourishment to all, rather than a lake, whose nature is limited and can easily grow stagnant and can no longer support life.

Pinnacle, but inside there is much pride that must be kept in check.
You may want to hide from the tumult of life, or from difficult situations. This may tempt
you to color the facts in order to protect harmony. Be careful of this tendency because it
often backfires.
You have an eye for precision and detail. Your taste in all aspects of life is enhanced
and you possess a certain class that others admire. If you make the most of these
qualities, your appearance is considerably improved, making you both attractive and
graceful. The world depends on those who maintain harmony and balance. 

""",

This is a highly creative period. Your self-expression is greatly enhanced. Your creative
and artistic talents will peak. You should do everything possible to refine these abilities
and make the most of them. Many under the 3 Pinnacle are drawn to writing, the
theater, singing, and dance. Your chances of success are also heightened. Hard work
in any artistic field that one has a talent for can result in much reward.
This is also a highly social and emotional time. You attract friends and admirers with
your charm and gregarious nature.
You have the ability to inspire and motivate people. Your upbeat energy causes people
to want to work with and for you.
This is a lucky period, as well. You can overcome problems with considerably less effort
than in the past.
All of this can lead to self-indulgence and lack of productivity. Life is a little easier, which
can make you less vigilant. You need focus and discipline. Under the influence of this
Pinnacle, hard work is the key and the challenge to making the most of your
opportunities.
Be careful of impulsive behavior or doing things on a lark. You must know your limits
during this period. Be careful of your money; balance your accounts. Guard against
disorderly thinking and behavior. Otherwise, you may do things you regret or simply
squander away so many opportunities. 
Children born under this Pinnacle must be disciplined and kept from being spoiled. An
early education in the arts will inspire the child to make the most of his or her artistic
talents.

This is a Pinnacle of hard work and many rewards. You have the opportunity to build a
foundation that will last. Your abilities as an organizer, manager, or simply the rock of
any institution are greatly increased. You are dependable and reliable. Your ability to
fulfill responsibilities is likewise enhanced. As a result of your industry and
perseverance, success is well within your reach. It is a step-by-step process in which
you build something by small bricks laid one after another.
You will find yourself caring for others in a very material way. Family and in-laws can be
burdensome since you are seen as the cornerstone of the foundation.
Your life is preoccupied with details and responsibilities that must be taken care of. You
have set in motion projects that are your children, demanding your constant attention.
While there are many rewards, there are also many frustrations. Your sense of your
own limits and the consuming nature of details may at times seem overwhelming.
You must remember that things that last require slow growth. You may mistakenly
believe that your progress should be faster or happen with greater ease.
The need for efficiency, orderliness, and methodical systems limit your creativity.
Your challenge is to be flexible and adaptable. Learn to play more and allow yourself to
be more spontaneous.
Children born under this Pinnacle will tend to be serious and affected by the financial
limitations of their parents. The child may feel the need to leave home early and start a
family of his own. He or she must be encouraged to be more farsighted and flexible.
The child should avoid jumping into the harsh realities of life too soon.

This is a period that will teach the realities of freedom and expansion. You will travel
great distances, meet many new and interesting people, experience many adventures, 
and essentially come to know the world. You are in a period of accelerated
experimentation and learning. Experience is your teacher.
Your ability with words is greatly increased. You can write and speak with ease. You are
also able to successfully promote yourself. In fact, this is the source of much adventure;
new opportunities for work, travel, and exotic experiences present themselves with
regularity.
Your challenge is to prevent yourself from becoming a rolling stone. You need to ground
yourself in a particular discipline, career, or relationship. This will not limit your freedoms
so much as give you a base for operation. Otherwise, you may find yourself skipping
from one meaningless job to the next, one superficial relationship after another. You
can also fall victim to the abuse of food, alcohol, sex, or drugs.
You may fear being anchored or tied down, which can cause you to skim the surface of
a pursuit you enjoy, or important relationships.
You must come to know the true meaning of freedom, which is unconditional love. You
give your love and energy without the condition of holding on to a place, a person, or an
occupation; and you expect the same in return -- to be loved for what you are, rather
than someone who belongs to another. There is a highly spiritual path offering itself that
requires detachment without loss of love.
Many turn away from this and instead choose to maintain a superficial relationship with
the world, or with other people.
You must cultivate your talents, especially your verbal and writing abilities. You are
likely a gifted salesperson, or promoter.
You must accept limitations as a necessary base for your freedom. Freedom cannot
exist without limitations, otherwise you would be without identity, and without existence.
""",
"6": """
Under this Pinnacle you will be very involved with family, friends, and your community.
You will face an increase in responsibilities and duties, but you have a greatly enhanced
sense of balance and perspective that allows you to handle emotional issues well. 
Your family demands much of your attention. Matters involving spouse and children
require much security, love, and sacrifice. You are the centerpiece of your family, the
one people come to for solace and understanding. You may feel an increased burden,
as you carry the cares of many. You will experience a deep sense of being needed.
This Pinnacle is full of love, closeness, and warmth, but you must rise to the challenges
that close relationships bring. You must settle and bring harmony to personal conflicts
between others. You are often the only one with perspective in a conflict. It is as if you
are the keeper of justice, bringing understanding and compromise to situations that are
polarized.
Under the influences of this Pinnacle -- especially at its outset -- people are often
married or start families. Children are born, in-laws come into your life. You are the
nucleus of a little world. You must maintain your dignity. This is a period that makes it
easier to sacrifice, but you can overdo it, becoming a doormat for others to step on
simply to maintain a degree of peace. Know your limits and maintain healthy
relationships.
This is a fine period for growth in business and financial matters. You attract people with
resources who can help to further your personal goals. Moreover, you are balanced in
your approach to business affairs. This can bring many rewards.
Your heightened sense of harmony and your genuine compassion makes you an
excellent counselor and healer, especially if you already have native talent in any of
these areas.
Personal health matters can also surface, causing you to reflect on diet, exercise, and
other health habits.
Your desire to help others is also increased. But this can lead you to poke yourself into
situations where you do not belong or delve too deeply into other people’s personal
affairs. Be careful not to meddle or interfere.
The 6 Pinnacle is a time of progress and growth as a full human being. You are capable
of developing yourself in many different directions -- as a loving mate and parent; a
sound businessperson; and as a pillar of your community. The time requires the
balance you possess, since you can easily stretch yourself in too many directions and
ultimately feel burned out by the demands in your milieu
""",
"7": """
This is a period of inner development and soul searching. You will deal with the deeply
important questions of personal existence and the meaning of life. You will need time to
be alone to contemplate your inner world. This is a time of spiritual growth. You will
experience a heightened sense of faith. The power of the universe will be the force that
carries you along.
You have an enhanced appreciation of poetry and nature. Walks in nature provide great
therapeutic value and spiritual nourishment.
This is a time of specialization. You will pursue some course of development with fervor
and focus. Your ability to concentrate will be greatly increased. Your desire to study in
all forms -- reading, self-reflection, and contemplation -- will reach an all-time high. Your
intuition is much more sensitive, making your path a little easier and more direct since
you know intuitively the appropriate next step.
Under this Pinnacle, you will become an expert in one particular field. Your capacity to
penetrate the depths of a subject area is enormous. You will look below the surface in
virtually everything you encounter. It is very possible that you will find yourself in a
teaching role.
You must consciously work on your closer relationships, especially with your spouse
and children. You must explain that your desire to turn inward is not an escape or an
avoidance of those you love, but a deep need for knowledge.
During this 7 Pinnacle, spiritual growth, increased knowledge, and wisdom are the big
rewards. The 7 Pinnacle provides the basis for contentment in older age, because you
now begin to understand life more deeply.
Your challenge is to avoid becoming critical or cynical of others. You can become so
withdrawn from society that you look down on others. You may forget that you, too, are
part of the imperfect human race. Sarcasm is the lowest form of communication, and a
trap you could fall victim to.
Your desire to attain some high degree of perfection is sincere. But that pursuit can
make you miserable if you lose perspective and fail to realize the relativity of human 
existence. Perfection is a Utopian goal, but an unrealistic ambition. It can cause you to
be dissatisfied with yourself and others. The 7 provides the possibility of true
refinement, insight, and a high degree of wisdom. This deep understanding is the basis
for self-love and true happiness. 
""",
"8": """
Under the influences of this Pinnacle, you will have greatly enhanced talent for dealing
successfully with business and finances. This is a time of material growth, a time of
expansion and reward. It is the cycle of harvest.
The 8 Pinnacle also increases your personal power. You have sound judgment and
vision. In fact, this is the basis of your financial success.
People sense your power and effectiveness. They defer to you much more easily and
look to you for answers. This makes it easier for you to use power without having to be
a bully or force your way through situations. They perceive your ableness and want to
join you in your vision. Others have faith in you.
You will be able to organize large enterprises. Problems do not threaten you so much
as provide a challenge. You yourself sense your enhanced personal powers and feel a
growing sense of stability and centeredness. You will be capable of influencing matter in
an almost magical way. As a result, you are extremely goal oriented, moving toward the
realization of your dreams with confidence and clarity.
Your challenge during this period is to maintain a hold on your human and spiritual
values. You must remain balanced between heaven and earth. There will be enormous
temptations to make money and status your only priorities, excluding the more human
or immaterial matters entirely. This will undoubtedly lead to losses. You are being tested
and instructed in the real value of money -- it is natural place in life. If money is placed
on a high altar, overshadowing all other facets of life, you will become its slave.
If you are balanced in your approach to money, and have proper perspective, this can
be a truly rewarding period, both materially and spiritually. That is the true promise of
the 8. 
The number 8 symbolizes the balance between the finite and infinite, matter, and spirit.
It offers a great opportunity to grow. 
""",
"9": """
This is a period in which you must identify with some larger project or goal that is bigger
than you. Your greatest satisfaction will be in providing for others, as well as for
yourself. Those in business will draw much personal gratification in knowing that they
are helping their employees support their families. Those involved in social activism -- a
particularly appealing choice of careers during the 9 Pinnacle -- will feel themselves
strengthened by the knowledge that they are advancing the safety and wellbeing of
society. The 9 Pinnacle is a time in which you apply your energies to the good of the
larger community.
As a result, there is an element of self-sacrifice present. To some degree, you must
subordinate your personal priorities to those of a larger cause. We are not suggesting
martyrdom but making a conscious effort on your part to strike a balance between the
good of your milieu and your own personal desires.
This is a good time for financial growth and progress in business affairs. It is a period in
which you face a large challenge and must give yourself entirely to it.
The 9 Pinnacle also promises much reward in drama, writing and art. You have a
heightened esthetic sense, and any latent artistic talent you already possess will be
enhanced and brought to the surface. If you have been in business, you may suddenly
be drawn to the arts as a benefactor or patron, supplying support for theater
productions or artists.
You will feel an increased sense of social responsibility and compassion for the many.
You will want to help those less fortunate than yourself and will likely apply yourself to
some social cause or philanthropy. This is a period in which you feel a greater love for
the good of your community, country, and the world.
Interestingly, you are not restricted by prejudice or boundaries of class or country. You
see humanity as a whole. Your love is not personal, however, but for the many. 
Many under the 9 Pinnacle are drawn to religion or philosophy and have the capacity to
spread some doctrine or teaching.

"22": """
This is a demanding time in which all your personal power comes to the surface and is
made available to you. At the same time, you face an enormous challenge in which all
that power is needed. This challenges is both physical and spiritual. The physical side is
obvious in some large enterprise or dream that you are struggling to make manifest.
The spiritual side is more hidden, but just as important, in that one must deliver the full 
wealth of his spiritual understanding and vision to create something great and lasting for
the general wellbeing of society.
Your mental powers are greatly enhanced. At the same time, your determination and
efficiency are proportionately increased, making you the master builder. The 22 is a
Master Number, which means that you must perceive something large in the archetypal
world and materialize it.
Everything you focus on is large -- your plans are big and cover long periods of time;
you envision making an enormous and lasting impact on the world. At the same time,
your problems and challenges are equally large. You will have to devote yourself
entirely to this dream. Without a full commitment to your largest ambitions, you will slip
into frustrations and the world of broken dreams.
This is why the 22 Pinnacle is so demanding -- nothing less than everything you have is
necessary to bring forth your full potential, and the gift you must give to the world. This
is a Pinnacle of extremes.
You are not alone, however, in your struggle. There is much spiritual and material
support to help you realize your plans. People are attracted to you who intuitively
understand your larger purpose. You gain a close following of friends and supporters
who feel enriched by participating in the dream you have articulated.
Courage is essential. You need confidence and faith to help you endure the challenges
of the period and help you overcome the many obstacles in your path.
You are eminently practical during this period. Your approach to problems is methodical
but bold. You are careful of details, yet courageous in your attack on the problems at
hand. It is a period in which you must dive in, never hesitating over the possible
consequences. Your personal life will likely take a back seat to the excitement of the
dream.
This is a Pinnacle of enormous potential requiring much effort. Your day has arrived.
Now you must make the most of it.

Check to see which one of these combinations applies by finding the single digit

Soul Urge 6, and Personality 1, or vice versa
Try to find a balance between the extremes of self-sacrifice and of selfish behavior.
Sometimes you take your duties and responsibilities too seriously; other times you
turn away from them. Codependence may be a problem for you. Be more
independent.
Soul Urge 7, and Personality 2, or vice versa
This combination is paradoxical: At the same time it is both disharmonious and
potentially gifted. You are sensitive and in need of love and attention, while also very
private and inwardly focused. This creates a certain amount of inner conflict. You
have a tendency for self-pity, and you tend to withdraw as soon as a relationship
shows the slightest bit of turmoil. You take criticism too personal. The high potential
comes from the combination of analytical power (7) and intuition (2) represented
here.
Soul Urge 8, and Personality 3, or vice versa
The combination of business-minded, goal-oriented, determined, and visionary eight,
and the playful, creative, outgoing, and happy-go-lucky three is unstable.
Your strength lies in using your creative talents in a business-oriented manner. Your
weakness is your tendency to suppress your creativity in favor of career and
business. This can make you overly cautious and slow to make decisions.
Soul Urge 9, and Personality 4, or vice versa
You should probably spend less time on petty details and direct your attention
towards increasing your awareness of world and humanitarian matters, large-scale
projects, and political and environmental issues. You tend to waste time and
potential. You should learn to delegate more. 
Be tolerant and flexible. Accept changes. Rigid ideas and dogmas may keep you
from reaching out and following your dreams. Make freedom a high priority in your
life.

The 7 and 1 mixture is generally harmonious, but the above-mentioned advice is

The 8 and 2 cause similar struggles but are often recognizable in broken romantic
relationships caused in part by over-sensitivity, criticism, a tendency to gossip, and
large fluctuations in financial matters. The positive side of this combination is your
innate ability to negotiate. You are both the leader and the diplomat.
Soul Urge 9 and Personality 3, or vice versa.

material matters. Excessive attachment to money, goods, and status quo can make
