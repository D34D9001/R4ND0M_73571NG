improving. People with a Numerology Life Path 1 are born to act quickly and 
have no problem changing course and starting down a new path. A secret fear

already running toward another. A feeling of isolation may follow people

Cooperating with other people in romantic relationships or teamwork settings 
can be difficult for number 1 people, who prefer to go their own way. They 
don't identify much with others' pursuits and only feel free when they are 
unattached. A thriving love life is not usually one of their goals. The Life 
Path 1 in Numerology likes to move quickly and this can come across as 
impatience or short-sightedness to others. However, it's this trait that 
makes people with a 1 Life Path number the early birds who are the first to 
take advantage new opportunities and the first to reap the rewards. While 
other people are weighing their options and making long-term plans, those 
with a Life Path 1 are already in motion, confident they can make things up 
as they go along.""",

harmonious existence. From the professional path they choose to who they

desire for peace. To this end, however, 2 people can be so passive that they 
miss out on their full potential. Whether this means staying silent about 
things that upset them or not asking for a raise or promotion to avoid 
rocking the boat, people with this Life Path can suffer from never putting 
their needs first. The subconscious mind is extremely powerful for a person 
born with a 2 Life Path. They may often just "know" things about people they 
meet or be able to sense the undercurrent of a situation before it reveals 
itself. This level of intuition allows people with a number Life Path number 
2 to get in front of problems and address them before they start to throw 
things off balance. In relationships, the ability to sense what another 
person is thinking or feeling gives these people an understanding, 
compassionate quality that makes others feel nurtured.""",

  "lp3": """ Charming, romantic, and full of creative energy, people who 
were born with a 3 Life Path number know how to embrace life! They tend to 
see the world through rose-colored lenses where everything looks like an 
opportunity and the chances for expression and enjoyment are endless. They 
have a tendency to be skilled communicators and have a knack for coming up 
with and sharing brilliant ideas. The Life Path 3 makes an excellent 
journalist, blogger, social media influencer, or author. People with a Life 
Path number 3 enjoy an active social life where they can interact with 
others often. From the moment of birth, their light is warm and exciting and 
draws many friends and admirers. They tend to be extroverted and embrace any 
opportunity to show off their original thoughts and stand-out personality. 
They have a way with words and can charm their way into anyone's heart. But 
while Life Path 3 people are great at attracting others, forming real, deep 
bonds is the difficult part. They want to keep things fun and new but feel 
they have to give that up if they make themselves vulnerable to intimacy. 
Those with this Life Path live in the moment, so the idea of committing to 
anything long-term can be a daunting one. A person with this Life Path 
number is very fun to be around, but could also benefit from embracing a 
deeper, more spiritual side of life. While those with a 3 Life Path truly 
enjoy who they are and what they do, there's a more meaningful level of 
experience and emotion that people with this Life Path may never even know 
exists. It's an untapped well of ideas to explore and engage with if they 
will muster up the courage to go to a deeper, more spiritual level. Though 
people born with a Life Path number 3 will be dealt both joy and hardship 
just like the rest of us, their unique way of thinking and dedication to 
happiness allow them to always see the silver lining. The power of 
positivity goes a long way for people with this Life Path. """,

  "lp4": """ Dedicated, patient, down to earth, and hard-working, people 
with a 4 Life Path number are a great source of stability in our world. They 
aren't interested in rocking the boat because they know that constant, 
steady effort is the surest path to their goals. Life Path 4 people are 
consistent in their methods and their moods and they keep themselves 
composed. They experience a range of emotions just like everyone else, but 
their practical way of processing their feelings keeps them from going to 
extremes. With a wide range of knowledge, Life Path number 4 people are 
natural teachers. They are confident in what they know and speak with such 
clarity and authority that others accept what they say. They need to 
remember, though, that they are also students and that there is always, 
always more to learn. Life Path 4 people tend to make firm decisions about 
what is "right" and close the door on anything new or different. Stuck with 
outdated methods and old information, these people may come up short of 
their true potential. In relationships, people with a 4 Life Path are 
honest, loyal, and committed, and they need the same from a partner. Trust 
and fidelity are vital to them and its important they find someone who 
shares their religious perspectives and values. 4 people will not waste 
their time with someone they're not compatible with, but when they find that 
special someone, they work hard to make the relationship successful and are 
in it for the long haul. Though a relationship with a Life Path number 4 
person won't be the most exciting one, it is sure to be stable and 
prosperous. """,

  "lp5": """ People with a 5 Life Path number are on a lifelong adventure. 
They are ready for anything and want to soak up every experience this world 
has to offer. Life Path number 5 people tend to learn by living and don't 
allow themselves to get stuck in any situation that has outworn its 
interest. The moment things start to get humdrum, a person with this Life 
Path will move on to something more fascinating. Routine is unbearable to 
people with a Life Path 5, so typical 9-5 jobs are not appealing to them. 
Though they will change their career path many times throughout life, 
positions that allow them the freedom to make their own decisions will be 
the most satisfying. And whether on the job or off, making time for travel 
will be key to feeling fulfilled for those with this Life Path. Meeting new 
people is no problem for a person with this Life Path number -- they are 
very social creatures by nature and enjoy engaging with others. What is more 
difficult for these people is maintaining friendships and romantic 
relationships beyond the initial stages. They have a tendency to lose 
interest and bow out before there's a chance to make a deeper connection. 
When they are in a relationship, people with a Life Path number 5 make 
exciting partners who want to show and share everything with their 
companion. However, their fickle and flighty nature makes it tough to ever 
really get close. If there's one thing a Life Path 5 person's life will 
never be, it's boring. To them, life is about experimenting and engaging and 
learning and enjoying and they can't wait to take it all in each and every 
day. Anyone with the 5 Life Path doesn't always know exactly where they're 
going, but they're guaranteed an epic journey. """,

  "lp6": """ People born with a Life Path 6 embrace their emotions and lead 
with their heart. They give off a warm and inviting energy that others want 
to be around. They enjoy many rich relationships throughout their life, both 
romantic and friendly. Whether these Life Path people encounter someone who 
is just like them or someone who is entirely different, they will treat them 
the same: with kindness, respect, and support. Some Life Path numbers only 
see black and white, but the Life Path number 6 can see and accept the 
infinite shades of grey between. With a natural ability to connect with 
others and offer aid and advice, 6 people do well as professional 
counselors, mentors, and teachers. These people are also natural 
humanitarians, eager to speak up, raise funds, and offer emotional support 
and protection for those that need it. This Life Path truly embraces the 
meaning of "A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle." They have an 
infinite well of love to give, and they know the world could use it. The 
love life of a person born with a 6 Life Path number is deep and romantic. 
They are refreshing to partners who may be used to lovers who don't relate 
as well to their feelings. Though not every relationship can be a lifelong 
one, 6 Life Path people are devoted to love and harmony and committed to 
making things last. What these people need to remember, however, is that 
they are also individuals. It may be noble to sacrifice oneself to love, but 
it's not healthy. People with a Life Path number 6 must remember to direct 
the same attention they give others onto themselves. Only then will they 
feel truly, universally balanced. """,

  "lp7": """ People born with a Life Path 7 are eternal students of the 
universe. They are introspective individuals with an unquenchable thirst for 
knowledge and they enjoy looking into the inner workings of things. Someone 
with this Life Path is a true thinker who lets their mind lead the way. 
Pretty much from the moment of birth, they are able to skillfully combine 
the exacting side of their brain with their divine intuitive side to learn 
about, process, and make sense of life itself. The 7 Life Path in Numerology 
is smart in a knowledgeable way, yet wise in a spiritual way. People with 
this Life Path number enjoy gaining book smarts, but they are also more 
connected to their higher self than most and have great access to this inner 
wisdom. While they are spiritual creatures, though, Life Path 7 people don't 
tend to be the religious type. Strict doctrines that don't make room for new 
information are a turn-off to these inquisitive folk. Similar to The Hermit 
in a Tarot deck, people born with a Life Path number 7 often go it alone. 
They like the freedom of not having to explain themselves and enjoy the 
control and possibility of solitude. Their social circle tends to be a small 
one made up of people with like-minded interests. They may come across to 
the world as a bit awkward in groups or when meeting new people. 
Romantically, people with this Life Path may find it hard to connect on an 
emotional level with others. They love the part of getting to know someone, 
asking questions and exchanging answers, but often lack the interest or 
ability to build a heartfelt bond. Professions that require research and 
problem-solving skills are a perfect fit for those with a Life Path 7. If 
given a quiet space to think and work, they'll dive deeper than anyone into 
a problem and come out with the most valuable and viable solution. Their 
analytical powers are off the charts and these skills make them an asset to 
any project or team. """,

  "lp8": """ The Life Path number 8 personality is one of hard work and hard 
lessons. People born with this Life Path number get their worth from 
accomplishing great things -- the bigger the goal, the more satisfying it 
feels when they achieve it. Money and material goods are important to them 
because they are rewards and reminders of all the effort put in. People with 
this Life Path direct all their energy into creating a life of success and 
abundance. Dealing with people in positions of authority is often tough for 
people born with an 8 Life Path number. Because they are leaders themselves 
and are supremely confident in their abilities, they don't take kindly to 
being told what to do -- especially if it goes against what they would 
choose to do. Life Path 8 people, too, can also come across as authoritative 
and must learn that all relationships are about harmony. With all the work 
these Life path people put into reaching their goals and feeling 
accomplished, they would be wise to pay attention to their health. Stress is 
the all-too-familiar enemy of those born with the 8 Life Path number and, if 
allowed, it will slow down or deter these people on their path to reaching 
their goals. Making time for meditation, friendship, and enjoyable pursuits 
helps to bring things back into balance. Health is wealth, so maintaining a 
healthy lifestyle should be a top priority. When it comes to relationships, 
people with an 8 Life Path will put in the same work and dedication that 
they put into everything else. They do well in long-term situations, but 
these relationships may look more like business arrangements than passionate 
love affairs. Life Path number 8 people see themselves as providers and 
willingly take on the role of supporting a partner or family. They know they 
are self-sufficient, but when they see that they are prosperous enough to 
also provide for loved ones, to them, that's proof of success. """,

  "lp9": """ There's a special kind of magic that follows people born with a 
9 Life Path number. They embody the wisdom of a sage, but not by chance -- 
they have fought their way through many challenges to reach this point and 
have gained immeasurable strength and awareness along the way. Life Path 
number 9 people will often find themselves in a position of providing 
support and advice and this feels natural to them. The knowledge they have 
gained can be incredibly valuable to others on their own journeys. A person 
who is born with a Life Path 9 tends to be spiritual and connects deeply 
with religion. Whether it stems from a need for strength during times of 
struggle or a natural desire to relate to something greater than themselves, 
Life Path number 9 people often seek courage and meaning from a higher 
source. Intuitions and gut reactions may even outweigh logic. This 
connection to the divine gives these people a safety net of confidence as 
they continue to make their way through life's good times and bad. People 
with a Life Path 9 may feel a great devotion to their fellow man. They are 
humanitarians by nature and use their big hearts to support those who have 
been made to feel inequal or unworthy. But because 9 Life Path people have 
become so accustomed to enduring their own challenges, others may not notice 
when they are in need and, unfortunately, they have a very difficult time 
asking for help. People with this Life Path number must realize that 
assistance is part of a cycle of give and take, and with as much support as 
they give, it's their karmic responsibility to receive support in 
return.""",

  "lp33": """ Birthdays that add up to a Life Path 33 are very rare -- it 
takes a specific and uncommon combination of numbers in a person's birth 
date to add up to this number. Anyone born with this Life Path number are 
known as "Master Teachers." They are healers and great spiritual leaders 
devoted to showing others how to connect to their own heart and 
consciousness. One of the most common traits for a Life Path number 33 is 
altruism. Their selfless spirit makes them excellent partners, as they are 
able to listen with intention and offer unparalleled emotional support. 
Being born with a Life Path 33 can feel like both a blessing and a curse. 
Individuals with this Life Path can experience a level of spiritual 
understanding and empathy that most others couldn't begin to comprehend. 
However, in order for them to achieve this, they must face a series of 
obstacles throughout their lives that will test them. One of their greatest 
lessons is to heal themselves before they can exercise their power of 
healing others. While it can take almost their entire lives to master being

that people with this Life Path number are able to achieve. """

# Expression Numbers

ex_dict = { "1": """ With a 1 Expression number, you possess strong 
leadership capabilities and a knack for creating your own opportunities. You 
will go where others are afraid to go and you'll make the journey look easy. 
The number 1's energy is extremely self-sufficient, allowing you to be most 
innovative and productive when you're working alone. You may even find it 
difficult to cooperate with others, preferring to do things your way rather 
than listening to anyone else's opinions. If you aren't careful, the 1 
Expression could make you seem aggressive and self-centered. It's not in 
your nature to think before you speak or act, but you would be wise to learn 
this skill! """,

"2": """ Working with others is your forte. Your 2 Expression makes you very 
skilled in relationships of all kinds, because it is cooperative, 
supportive, and always striving for balance. You have a keen ability to read 
people and situations and react with patience and understanding. Others see 
you as peaceful and humble, yet there is great strength in you. Still, your 
feelings can be easily hurt and you have a tendency to doubt yourself when 
making decisions, which can make you idle. You would benefit from following 
your head instead of your heart from time to time. """,

"3": """ With the influence of the number 3, you are a naturally skilled 
communicator. You have a way with words and a great talent for conveying 
your creative ideas and inspiring others. Your social circle is strong and 
people find your optimistic attitude both magnetic and charming. However, 
the relationships you form, like many other things in your life, don't go 
very deep. Your enthusiasm for life can be a distraction, making you unable 
to stay focused on one person, job, or plan long enough for it to develop 
into something complete or meaningful. """,

"4": """ Organized, down-to-earth, and hardworking, the 4 Expression gives 
you skills that make you incredibly capable and constructive. You are a 
master at managing projects and teams and others rely on you because you 
follow everything through to completion. You are honest, patient, and loyal 
-- sometimes, loyal to a fault. The number 4 carries a stubborn, rigid 
energy that can make you so fixed in your ways that you are unable to grasp 
new, better ways of thinking, doing, and interacting. """,

"5": """ Your 5 Expression craves variety and freedom and wants to 
experience everything that life has to offer. You are an adventurous person 
who takes pleasure in trying new things and following your latest passion. 
Your passions change quickly, however, so you've learned to switch gears 
easily in order to explore as many possibilities as you can. Beware, though, 
that with all this change comes inconsistency. Your restlessness can make 
you unreliable in relationships and unprepared to handle the hardships of 
life. """,

"6": """ Your strengths play out most notably in your relationships with 
others. The influence of the number 6 makes you incredibly protective and 
nurturing toward all people, but especially your family members and other 
close loved ones. You have a heart of gold and feel a responsibility to be 
there to help those in need of support. It's important, though, that you 
don't forget about self-care. You can be so focused on the well-being of 
others that you neglect to attend to your own emotions and energy levels. Be 
kind to yourself, too. """,

"7": """ You are the truth seeker. You are energized by information and 
willing to go deep into both the intellectual and spiritual realms in search 
of real meaning. Logic drives the way you think and communicate, and this 
helps you clearly convey your vast knowledge to others. You are not 
satisfied with what's on the surface -- it's the hidden answers you are 
digging for. However, this assumption that there is always something to be 
found can make you suspicious of others. In fact, it may be hard for you to 
relate to other people in general; you tend to prefer a controlled 
environment where you can do things your own way. """,

"8": """ An 8 Expression blesses you with great business sense and excellent 
judgement of people, money, and plans. This is why you are able to achieve 
so many goals -- you know the best resources and the most attainable 
ambitions. You do run the risk of being too ambitious, however, and turning 
from an effective leader into an impatient taskmaster. While your drive to 
attain success and material wealth is powerful, it's important that you 
balance it with meaningful people, emotions, and experiences. """,

long as you are immersing yourself in this altruistic work. If you are not 
living life in a way that is beneficial to other people, you could become 
self-centered and detached from important emotions. """,

profound intuitive capabilities and an idealistic vision. You are driven by

"Master Builder" because it is capable of constructing grand ideas and even

to solving problems and a desire to help others. You are headstrong and 
driven, yet this brings a risk of becoming so domineering that you lose the 
support of others. Remember that your goal is to create, not to destroy. You

# Hearts Desire

heart_dict = { "1": """ Your Soul Urge is to be the driving force in life. 
You have a deep belief that what you feel, say and do has great value in the 
world (and you’re right). You desire to be heard, and for others to follow 
your lead. You trust your own instincts, often above the views and 
perspectives of others, and have the makings of a great leader and a pioneer 
for change. You may have issues with authority throughout your life, not 
least because your self-assuredness often means that others look to you for 
guidance and direction, regardless of the position you take. You are 
committed and loyal, however, your dominant nature means others are easily 
silenced in your presence, and you may not even notice the hurt feelings of 
those you leave in your wake. You must be careful that your confidence isn’t 
confused with arrogance, and your desire for progress doesn’t create 
needless competition. Whilst you’ll never be fulfilled unless in a position 
of authority or power, try to make friends on the way up. You never know 
when you may need some loyalty in return. """,

"2": """ Your Soul Urge is to be needed, admired and loved by all. You are 
motivated by relationships and have a deep need to connect with others. You 
are sensitive and tactful and always striving to ensure harmony, balance, 
and cooperation prevail wherever you are. In fact, life can begin to feel 
very uncomfortable, very quickly at the first sign of conflict or drama, so 
you do your very best to keep the peace (and it’s something you’re good at!) 
You may have issues with self-trust throughout your life, not because you 
don’t value yourself, but because you always need someone else’s opinion or 
perspective to measure, contrast or connect to your own. Without an external 
point of reference, you can feel lost, or even lonely. Your strong, often 
intuitive connection to others means that you’re a natural team player and a 
valuable contributor to the whole. But you must ensure that your kindness 
and sensitivity doesn’t leave you too open or vulnerable. Strong emotional 
boundaries will ensure you’re not taken advantage of in life. """,

"3": """ Your Soul Urge is to cultivate and express your own personal magic. 
You’re inspiring, witty and original and instinctively see the positive side 
to every situation. You seek pleasure and fun and this makes you magnetic to 
other people, as you can’t help but share your shiny perspective with 
everyone around you. You’re a performer at heart and love nothing more than 
an adoring audience. This means you have the potential to achieve great fame 
and recognition in your life, especially within the Arts. You’re likely to 
be disorganized and even scattered in your approach to life. This can make 
you appear uncommitted or disloyal, so it’s vital for you to learn to 
channel and devote your creativity to fewer, larger projects as you grow. 
You will always have critics in life – this is part of the territory for a 
Soul Urge 3, so your challenge is to rise above them and develop fierce 
self-love. """,

"4": """ Your Soul Urge is to find beauty, order and stability in the chaos 
of life. You find a Zen-like satisfaction in performing the simplest 
repetitive, domestic or practical chores as you feel in most alignment with 
your essence when restoring harmony to unbalanced situations. You are a 
creator of systems and love to make plans and organize the world around you. 
Others feel an innate sense of security and stability when near you, and 
you’re often called upon for advice and counsel. It’s likely that you fear 
change or uncertainty, which means you may miss out on opportunities to 
grow. It’s important that you give yourself enough space for spontaneous 
actions, and frequently do things that take you out of your comfort zone. 
You’re incredibly loyal, patient and generous. But your straight-talking 
attitude can sometimes be received as a little harsh or unkind (though never 
intentional) so developing greater skills of empathy and tact, would likely 
serve you well. """,

"5": """ Your Soul Urge is to experience as much variety as you can. You 
have an inquisitive mind and a thirst for adventure that is only satisfied 
when you’re on a quest of discovery. Travel is your passion, and you feel at 
your most alive when you’re on the open road, meeting new people and 
experiencing new things. This means that you may quickly become jaded or 
restless and struggle with commitment in ordinary life. And if you feel too 
hemmed in, either by a situation or a partner, then you’ll quickly find ways 
to rebel. Your enthusiasm inspires others and you easily make friends. 
Unfortunately, maintaining these relationships can be much harder for you, 
as once the initial spark of excitement has worn off you’re often resistant 
to opening up to others in deeper ways. You have an innate sense of trust 
that the Universe will look after you, but don’t easily share this trust 
with the people in your life, so learning to be vulnerable with others is a 
great challenge, but one which will ultimately bring you much strength and 
fulfillment. """,

and have a true gift for creating the right conditions for others to 
flourish and reach their highest potentials. You have a deep need to provide 
for other people’s needs and an intuitive sense of what those needs are. You 
are happiest when you can see the positive results of your influence 
unfolding, and witness the people around you thriving and happy. But this 
selfless approach to life can often lead to you neglecting your own needs, 
so you must ensure your energy does not become depleted and you regularly 
care for yourself, as much as for others. You may have perfectionist 
tendencies, leading to very high expectations of yourself and of others 
which means it can be very difficult for you or anybody else to reach the 
lofty goals you set. This can lead to disappointment and resentment, so you 
must learn to let go, or true fulfillment and happiness will always be 
elusive. """,

You’re a natural seeker of knowledge, on an endless quest to find out the 
“hows” and “whys” of life. Whether in scientific, historical, literary or 
mystical realms, you have a deep yearning to always understand more. Because 
of your questioning nature, you can often feel as though you don’t quite 
belong in the world. That other are able to simply accept things at face 
value is a mystery to you, so it’s likely that you instinctively separate 
yourself from them and may be perceived as an outsider. In truth, you are 
unique, and your perspectives are of great value to the world. Discovering 
healthy expressions and outlets for your thoughts and theories is vital if 
you are to fulfill your potential, and gain the trust of your peers. You 
must also work to develop self-trust, as however much groundwork and 
research you do, ultimately, your truth will be found within. """,

"8": """ Your Soul Urge is to find power, status, and prosperity. You are 
motivated by success and achievement, especially when it’s rewarded 
financially. But this isn’t a selfish yearning – your desire to control 
resources stems from a deep need to improve the lives of others and 
distribute wealth accordingly. You understand commerce, trade, and industry 
and want it to benefit those you love. You are confident, ambitious and have 
high levels of stamina. Your strong sense of purpose may come across as 
domineering to others, but really you just want to achieve the success that 
you work so hard for! Your challenge is not to be overcome by material 
gains, but to go the extra mile and use the money and power that you so 
naturally magnetize, for the greater good. You are a natural leader, so 
ensure that you lead by example and act with integrity at all times. You 
have the capacity to instill great trust and respect from others, so it’s 
vital that the power you wield isn’t abused. """,

"9": """ Your Soul Urge is to make the world a better place for the 
collective. You’re a humanitarian at heart, and yearn to leave a lasting 
legacy of wellness and love wherever you go. Deeply altruistic, you only 
want the best for people, and have the rare gift of seeing into their souls 
and knowing exactly what this is. You have visionary perspectives and are 
unwaveringly positive. You have the uncanny ability to always see (and 
believe) in the best possible outcome in any situation. You desire to impart 
your wisdom, experience, and insight to others, but must be careful that 
your well-wishes don’t come across as overbearing. Often regarded as someone 
who has all the answers (and willingly offers them) can mean that others 
come to resent and rebel against your advice. Or alternatively, they resist 
thinking for themselves when they’re around you, so you must be very careful 
that your desire to help doesn’t interfere with others’ need to find their 
own way through life, and crucially, make their own mistakes. It is also 
important for you to learn the art of fair exchange. You have such a 
generous spirit that you can easily give, give and give without receiving 
anything in return. Your idealistic nature would love to believe you are 
setting an example, but in reality, you could be creating an unhealthy 
imbalance of energy. """,

"11": """ Your Soul Urge is to trust your inner voice and express this 
confidently into the world. You are a sensitive and insightful soul, and 
it’s likely that you have psychic gifts and the ability to channel 
high-frequency information. This can be a challenge – you may often feel 
ungrounded or nervous, or too empathically aware of what others are feeling. 
You are creative and have a calming influence on others. In fact, it’s 
likely that other people are instinctively drawn to you, sensing your highly 
healing frequencies by simply being in your presence. You may often feel 
like you are on a search for deep, spiritual truths and try to find these in 
many other people and their teachings. But your challenge is to go within 
and seek the peace you so desire inside of yourself. """,

unlikely that you regard your visions as anything but ordinary! Just like 
the Soul Urge 4, others feel an innate sense of security and stability when 
near you, so you inspire a great deal of confidence in them. As such, you 
will make a great leader, manager, and organizer of people. In fact, you 
will begin to realize your true calling only when you begin to see your 
grandest visions materializing with the help of others, whom you have 
carefully directed. You must be sure that you follow your souls calling in 
life, and do not become lethargic and too safely confined in your comfort

highly-adaptable and need excitement. You relate well to others and have an 
easy way with words. In fact, you have a talent for promotion, public

arts, especially the visual arts, such as painting, calligraphy, or 
sculpture. There is a yearning within you to ground within the family or 
community structure, but there is a hint of wanderlust, too, which makes 
grounding difficult. You want the best in your life, and you strive for it. 
Commitment to relationships - especially home and marriage - is a central 
issue in your life. You must be willing to bring out the best in your 
partner, or the place you live. In the same way, you must truly commit to 
your own abilities - make the most of them! Honor your talent and cultivate 
it with hard work and refinement. You are very sensitive. Criticism has a 
very negative effect on you. For this reason, you tend to support others to 
the point of denying yourself. You want to live according to the Golden 
Rule, which is that you treat others as you would want to be treated. You 
are generous and understanding. As a parent, you are devoted to your 
children and can maintain stability and love within the family. You tend to 
be demonstrative in your affections. You probably look young for your age. 
In addition to your artistic talent, you possess sound business and 
financial instincts. You tend to be thorough and conscientious in your 
approach to business, traits that pay off in the long run. You must beware 
of becoming too soft in relationships. People can see you as an easy mark,

understanding in practical terms so that it can be effectively shared with 
others. You have a fine analytical mind that is capable of penetrating 
beneath the surface of the subject at hand. You also have the capacity for 
excellent concentration. You must use that mind to your greatest advantage. 
Investigate the subjects you love and gain the depth of knowledge in these 
fields. Specialize. Become an expert in a given area. This will give you a 
means of earning a living and personal power to share your wisdom. The great 
pitfall you face is the choice of becoming aloof, mental, and critical. This 
will result in alienation and even bitterness. You can also easily lift off 
the ground, becoming impractical and dreamy. If you indulge too much in 
flight of fancy, you may drift from reality and give up the possibility of 
earning an adequate living. You have excellent intuition and may even 
possess psychic ability. Trust your intuition and use it as a guide in life. 
But at all times, be practical in your application of your insights. Find 
concrete means of expressing yourself. Pick a field that suits you - 
science, metaphysics, philosophy, psychology, teaching, for example - and 
deepen yourself in its understanding. But beware of becoming overly dogmatic 
and shut off from the truths of others. You prefer to work alone, rather 
than in a group. You can easily lose interest in your projects, however, and 
must work hard to finish what you start. You have to have faith and let 
opportunities come your way, you may miss out if you reach and seek. You are 
very sensitive and feel deeply, but you don't share your feelings easily, 
nor do you communicate them well. The realm of the heart troubles you for

parents, co-workers, or your community. Your challenge is to learn 
acceptance and forgiveness. There is an element of sacrifice in your life. 
You need to let go of all negative attachments. Any thoughts of revenge will 
backfire badly against you. You need to employ your spiritual and

an Island unto himself... We are all bits of the main." This is a central 
lesson in your life: to learn the difference between the dream of 
independence and the reality of interdependence. Your challenge is to 
achieve a wider degree of perspective on yourself and others. Exchange ideas

important fixture in any enterprise in which you are involved. People are 
attracted to your deep commitment to your work, and the steadiness with 
which you do it. You are a pioneer at heart; you are willing to take risks 
to get what you desire. As such, you are willing to change your environment 
often, and even enjoy doing so. You are demonstrative in your affections and 
willing to sacrifice for others. You are highly idealistic, but if your 
ideals fail, you can become bitter and negative. You are very sensitive,

a great need to develop and maintain your own center. Once you have 
accomplished this task, life will become more manageable and less 
threatening. You are especially moved by beauty, harmony, and love. You give 
affection and need much in return. You especially need physical affection, 
that is, plenty of hugs and warmth. You like to spend time with family and

lies in your keen insight and your willingness act as an advisor to those

others think they are brilliant. Your high sensitivity makes you aware of

Karmic Debt don’t concentrate their energies in a specific direction or on a 
single task, but scatter their attention over many projects, none of which 
amount to much.
A temptation with the 13 is to take shortcuts. Easy success doesn't come

self-image and the belief that one is incapable of amounting to much.

Life will present challenges to your grand plans which you may resent and 
struggle against. It is a losing battle… and you will likely feel humbled in 
the face of the collapse that follows. However, humility is the key to later 
success, as you learn to follow the intimations of a deeper reality.
In the destruction of the old, an inner rebirth takes place with an entirely 
new awareness. This rebirth affects every area of your life - a far better 
life for the fall.
Those with the 16 Karmic Debt must be careful of egoism. Often, those with 
the 16 use their highly intuitive and refined intellect to look down on 
others. This can cause acute alienation and loneliness. In addition, it 
invites retribution, for the egotist is humbled more harshly than any other.
When the 16 is found in one of the core numbers, the process of destruction 
and rebirth is a continual cycle that serves to bring you into higher 
consciousness and a deeper connection to elevated ideals.
The 16 Karmic Debt can be a path of progress and great spiritual growth if 
it is viewed properly. One develops faith in life by broadening a limited 
outlook, listening (expanding intuition), questioning old ways, and staying 
open to a new path.
The great pitfall you face is the choice of becoming aloof and critical. 
This will result in alienation and even bitterness. You can also easily lift 
off the ground, becoming impractical and dreamy. If you indulge too much in 
flight of fancy, you may drift from reality and give up the possibility of 
earning an adequate living.
The 16 excellent intuition, not unlike the Master number 11, and may even 
possess psychic ability. Trust your intuition and use it as a guide in life. 
But always, be practical in your application of your insights.
With a Karmic Debt 16, you can easily lose interest in your projects and 
must work hard to finish what you start. You must have faith and let 
opportunities come your way.
You are sensitive and feel deeply, but you don't share your feelings easily, 
nor do you communicate them well. The realm of the heart troubles you for 
its shifting, nebulous qualities. You must work hard to understand this area 
of life. """,

"19": """ A person with the 19 Karmic Debt will learn independence and the 
proper use of power. One of the central lessons for people with the 19 
Karmic Debt revolves around stubbornly resisting help from others. Much of 
your independence is self-imposed - you simply want to do it your own way.
The 19 Karmic Debt can become a self-imposed prison if you don’t recognize 
the need for interdependence and the mutual need for love.
Although you seek to stand on your own feet, you are inextricably connected 
to others and in need of the support and understanding that all people need 
- this is the most important lesson for the 19 Karmic Debt.
Those with the 19 Karmic Debt learn the hard way that "no one is an island," 
and that we are, indeed, "all bits of the main!"
Strong and individualistic, self-reliant, and confident; this Karmic Debt 
number can bring loneliness and alienation due to a lack of support from 
others.
You tend to struggle to achieve the degree of self- sufficiency you desire 
and may endure considerable frustration in your struggle for independence. 
The reason: your desire for independence is so strong is that it eclipses 
many other balancing perspectives.
Your challenge is to achieve a wider degree of perspective on yourself and 
others. Exchange ideas with others, lest you become insulated and isolated 
by your own perspective. This can become a kind of prison for you.
You can be highly stubborn, which emanates from fear. Try to see that all of 
life is but an ecosystem, a life cycle delicately balanced in such a way 
that everyone is supporting.
You will be placed in situations where you are forced to stand up for 
yourself (and often be left standing alone). Difficulties are faced and 
overcome through personal struggle. You are highly ambitious and have a 
strong drive for success and power.
Although self-confident, you like to be encouraged. You are a hard worker 
and an important fixture in any enterprise in which you are involved. People 
are attracted to your deep commitment to your work, and the steadiness with 
which you do it. You are a pioneer at heart; you are willing to take risks 
to get what you desire. As such, you are willing to change your environment 
often, and even enjoy doing so.
You are demonstrative in your affections and willing to sacrifice for 
others. You are highly idealistic, but if your ideals fail, you can become 
bitter and negative. You are very sensitive, with many emotional ups and 
downs. You tend to find yourself in dramatic situations, yet you like to 
control your emotions in public and come off as if everything is under 
control.
With your determination and inventive and creative mind you have potential 
for achievement and financial reward! """

hypersensitivity causes fear, timidity and lack of self-confidence. And you 
experience unnecessary fear and emotional turmoil. Little things seem 
disproportionately difficult to overcome and sometimes have a paralyzing 
effect. Jealousy can cause much pain and misunderstanding. These negative

being that you are now repressing: the child within.
All the characteristics that have to do with the irrational and holistic 
side of life - spirit, humor, playfulness, and intuition - are being shut 
out. Your challenge is to find some philosophy and, ideally, a community 
that will give you additional perspectives, and force you to bring out the 
many other characteristics that are a fundamental part of you. Otherwise, 
you risk loneliness and isolation.

the invisible world - thoughts, emotions, insight, and love - you can begin 
to appreciate that only a small part of life is within the domain of your 
senses.

transformation that will set free the inner being you are keeping trapped 
within you.

For many with this challenge, there is a danger of becoming so obsessed with 
materialism that they may be tempted to ruthless and unscrupulous business 
practices, possibly crossing the borders of the law and causing themselves

## Rational Thought Numbers

influenced by others. You tend to pursue a line of thought stubbornly, and 
you can be dominating in intellectual discussions. You tend to solve 
problems and plan projects with a straight-forward approach. You rarely 
allow yourself to be distracted. Quite often, you realize at some later 
stage, that you did not pay enough attention to the available alternatives, 
and a project may find itself stuck with no chance of further advancement. 
When you find yourself facing such a situation your frustration tends to be 
considerable but of short duration. You simply start all over. You do not 
give up easily. """,

"2":""" You take the subtle approach. You allow your intuition to be a large 
part of your intellectual explorations. You are open to the ideas of others, 
and you may be a little too easily influenced. When you consider a project 
or face a problem, you tend to allow too many alternatives to cloud the 
issue. However, when it comes to recognizing the many possible variations, 
and how they may affect the outcome, you are hard to beat. You have an 
uncanny ability to plan projects and solve problems which require a large 
number of people to actively participate, while at the same time maintaining 
a sense of harmony and unity among those involved. """,

"3":""" You are creative, but your thoughts tend to be scattered. You jump 
around inside your head without much focus. You produce solutions that 
reveal an illogical approach, yet they often work. As it applies to you, 
rational thinking is a contradiction in terminus. You project, interpret, 
and analyze your projects and problems in a manner that often leaves others 
flabbergasted. However, you are unbeatable when it comes to shining new and 
original light on issues; often producing unique answers. You have this 
Rational Thought number in common with a number of famous and original 
thinkers -- and the keyword here is original -- throughout history. """,

"4":""" You are the practical, methodical thinker. You think things through 
step by step, and you are almost always well-prepared when others question 
your reasoning. You may be a little rigid in your approach and you tend to 
be uncomfortable with new, unproven ideas. You avoid risks, in favor of 
established procedures. You have no desire to reinvent the wheel. Others 
tend to trust your judgments and value your participation, in particular 
because you often function as the proverbial rock in rough waters. You are a 
stabilizing voice when involved in team projects, especially when chaos 
tends to take over. """,

"5":""" You have a flexible and adaptable mind. You are quick with 
solutions, and you can think on your feet. You have the cunning of a fox. 
You can talk yourself out of the tightest situations, but your priority is 
often winning the contest, not being right. You love to reinvent the wheel. 
You have no fear of trying an approach that seems farfetched to others. Your 
adaptability is unique, and you often manage to turn a difficult situation 
around to make it work in your favor. """,

"6":""" You are a listener, and you tend to relate everything to the effect 
it has on others. You notice things that escape others, but when you try to 
find solutions, you often focus on details, forgetting the larger picture. 
Justice is a major factor in your thinking, many people in the legal field 
have this number. When it comes to approaching a project or a problem that 
requires insight into the hearts and minds of children, very old people, or 
anyone who is disadvantaged in body or spirit, you have few equals. You are 
a natural defender of those who cannot defend themselves. Depending on the 
core-numbers of your chart, you may want to consider a career in the legal 
field, or in the areas of teaching and healing. """,

all the aspects of a question until you feel you understand the problem 
completely. Then you proceed to solve it with clarity and without 
hesitation. Few people are able to compete with you when it comes to finding 
answers. You recognize the underlying factors in a problem situation before 
anyone else, and you are often able to analyze them in a unique and 
insightful way. You are a perfectionist and quickly frustrated when you work 
with people who like to take short-cuts. You appreciate quality more than 
quantity in any situation. """,

"8":""" You are the visionary, and you focus on the larger picture. You 
ignore the details in favor of spectacular solutions. You love to blow 
someone’s mind. You understand the balance between the rational and the 
irrational, and you have no problem combining the two. You have a vivid 
imagination, and you are often surprised that other do not immediately grasp 
a concept that seems clear and logical to you. You have little patience when 
others allow fear and caution to slow down a project. """,

"9":""" You are always aware of the expectations of others, and you hold off 
on expressing your opinion until everyone has had their say; then you point 
to the mistakes and the things that were overlooked. Your success in solving 
problems and in finding answers is the result of a process of elimination, 
more than it is a matter of stringing together logical answers. """,

"11":""" The 11 is the illuminator. You have answers and insights based on 
the proverbial light bulb. Your Rational Thought number is the most magical 
and difficult to understand (for others). You have the makings of an 
inventor, or a spiritual guide. You would do well relying heavily on your 
intuition. You sense things more accurately than you analyze.
 """,

"22":""" A combination of vision and system gives your Rational Thought 
number the most potential for success. You can switch quickly from the 
larger picture to any minute detail that requires your attention at that 
time. You dream big, and you have the capacity to lay a foundation for your 
dream that gives clear directions for each step, each little detail, which 
needs to be taken care of. A 22 Rational Thought number can only result from 
the 11 of the name and the 11 or 29 Birth Day. This reveals a strong 
intuitive side in you. Premonitions and an intuitive assessment of future 
effects are strong aspects that can be used and strengthened. """,

Keep focused on your dreams. This Pinnacle will require an iron will to keep 
hold of your goals, and also the flexibility to maneuver around 
difficulties, and bend with the winds of adversity. This is a period of 
rapid self-improvement and growth. You will be forced to use every talent 
and capability you possess. You will need to be resourceful. You must

there is no accomplishment nor satisfaction, only a negative attitude toward 
life. Be careful not to become too self-centered, headstrong, or 
self-important. Be strong but flexible. Be open to the counsel of others but 
make up your own mind. The benefit of this Pinnacle number is a strong sense

work against you. You will find the most satisfactory roles to be 
supportive. You are now a gifted advisor, a diplomat, and a peacemaker. Your 
insight into other people’s feelings and motivations is so acute that you 
seem to be able to see right to the core of things. But rather than use 
these gifts to create differences between people, you must use them to 
create peace, to mend rifts, to harmonize. Your challenge during this period

recognize the value of both sides of an argument and be able to see the 
middle ground where peace can be made. You can create the atmosphere in

feelings, to be too easily hurt. You may lack self-confidence, especially at 
the beginning of the Pinnacle when your heightened sensitivity and awareness 
make you conscious of your own shortcomings. You may succumb to fear and 
hesitation. All of this can lead to emotional turmoil. You need courage and 
the willingness to reach out for support. Your sensitivity will make you 
acutely appreciative of beauty and harmonious environments. At the same 
time, you need beauty and harmony around you. You have an increased appetite

coming to the surface. If you do not already play an instrument, give in to

situations. This may tempt you to color the facts in order to protect 
harmony. Be careful of this tendency because it often backfires. You have an 
eye for precision and detail. Your taste in all aspects of life is enhanced

reach. It is a step-by-step process in which you build something by small 
bricks laid one after another. You will find yourself caring for others in a 
very material way. Family and in-laws can be burdensome since you are seen 
as the cornerstone of the foundation. Your life is preoccupied with details

skim the surface of a pursuit you enjoy, or important relationships. You 
must come to know the true meaning of freedom, which is unconditional love. 
You give your love and energy without the condition of holding on to a 
place, a person, or an occupation; and you expect the same in return -- to 
be loved for what you are, rather than someone who belongs to another. There 
is a highly spiritual path offering itself that requires detachment without 
loss of love. Many turn away from this and instead choose to maintain a 
superficial relationship with the world, or with other people. You must 
cultivate your talents, especially your verbal and writing abilities. You

attention. Matters involving spouse and children require much security, 
love, and sacrifice. You are the centerpiece of your family, the one people 
come to for solace and understanding. You may feel an increased burden, as 
you carry the cares of many. You will experience a deep sense of being 
needed. This Pinnacle is full of love, closeness, and warmth, but you must 
rise to the challenges that close relationships bring. You must settle and 
bring harmony to personal conflicts between others. You are often the only 
one with perspective in a conflict. It is as if you are the keeper of 
justice, bringing understanding and compromise to situations that are 
polarized. Under the influences of this Pinnacle -- especially at its outset

come into your life. You are the nucleus of a little world. You must 
maintain your dignity. This is a period that makes it easier to sacrifice, 
but you can overdo it, becoming a doormat for others to step on simply to 
maintain a degree of peace. Know your limits and maintain healthy 
relationships. This is a fine period for growth in business and financial 
matters. You attract people with resources who can help to further your 
personal goals. Moreover, you are balanced in your approach to business 
affairs. This can bring many rewards. Your heightened sense of harmony and 
your genuine compassion makes you an excellent counselor and healer,

meddle or interfere. The 6 Pinnacle is a time of progress and growth as a 
full human being. You are capable of developing yourself in many different 
directions -- as a loving mate and parent; a sound businessperson; and as a 
pillar of your community. The time requires the balance you possess, since 
you can easily stretch yourself in too many directions and ultimately feel 
burned out by the demands in your milieu """, "7": """ This is a period of 
inner development and soul searching. You will deal with the deeply

specialization. You will pursue some course of development with fervor and 
focus. Your ability to concentrate will be greatly increased. Your desire to 
study in all forms -- reading, self-reflection, and contemplation -- will

path a little easier and more direct since you know intuitively the

enormous. You will look below the surface in virtually everything you 
encounter. It is very possible that you will find yourself in a teaching 
role. You must consciously work on your closer relationships, especially 
with your spouse and children. You must explain that your desire to turn 
inward is not an escape or an avoidance of those you love, but a deep need

deeply. Your challenge is to avoid becoming critical or cynical of others.

may forget that you, too, are part of the imperfect human race. Sarcasm is 
the lowest form of communication, and a trap you could fall victim to. Your 
desire to attain some high degree of perfection is sincere. But that pursuit 
can make you miserable if you lose perspective and fail to realize the 
relativity of human existence. Perfection is a Utopian goal, but an 
unrealistic ambition. It can cause you to be dissatisfied with yourself and

easier for you to use power without having to be a bully or force your way

excluding the more human or immaterial matters entirely. This will 
undoubtedly lead to losses. You are being tested and instructed in the real 
value of money -- it is natural place in life. If money is placed on a high 
altar, overshadowing all other facets of life, you will become its slave. If

purpose. Taurus people work at a slower pace than most, but they always 
finish whatever projects they start. Because of this, they are reliable, 
trustworthy, careful and steadfast. Possessions and material things are 
usually of great significance to Taurus natives. This intense need to 
possess and enjoy with the senses can drive Taurus natives to be extremely 
productive or extremely acquisitive. But, they do have a decided fear of 
loss. The feelings that usually accompany this fear of loss are 
possessiveness, jealousy, laziness, stubbornness and extravagance. If there 
is no desire to possess anything or anyone, then there is no fear of loss.

They love to do several things all at the same time, sometimes making them 
late for appointments. They abhor boredom. One of the air signs, Gemini 
natives tend to flit from one experience to another, gathering in all types 
of information along the way, but seldom getting to the depth of any 
subject. They go broad and not deep. Persistence is not their strong suit. 
Gaining knowledge and disseminating; it is their real talent. Hence, they 
make wonderful salespeople or teachers if they stick around long enough to 
get all the facts instead of only half the story. Even if they do not 
possess all the facts, since they are never at a loss for words, they will 
continue with their story as if they did have all the facts. Since Gemini 
natives can see both sides of any issue, they may fluctuate back and forth 
between opposing viewpoints. They will usually tend to side with the opinion 
of whomever they happen to be with at the moment. Then they change as the 
circumstances change. Indecisiveness is a problem for Gemini natives. Some

mood swings are sometimes difficult for others to understand and deal with. 
Cancer natives are tenacious, sympathetic, industrious, friendly, thrifty, 
and protective. They can also be contentious, sensitive, emotional, 
martyr-like, intuitive, psychic, and patriotic. Cancer natives respond to 
life through their emotions rather than through their minds. They tend to 
absorb the emotional vibrations of wherever they’re at, so it is essential 
to always be in favourable environments. Because they live in their 
feelings, they unconsciously seek sympathy and attention and affection from 
others. They have a strong need to feel secure. Home and family bring the

that give them full scope for creativity, organising, and leadership. 
Although appearing strong on the outside, most Leos are inwardly sensitive,

object of their affection, when their pride is hurt. Leo natives have a 
decided flair for the dramatic, and they enjoy telling stories, being the 
centre of attention, having a good time, and running the show. Mean and 
cruel acts are generally beneath them, but they do not hesitate to use force 
when needed. No matter what their actions, they always have the belief that 
whatever they do is for the other person’s benefit. If a Leo is angered, he

something they cannot stand. A Virgo can be depended upon to fulfil a 
promise. They have a flair for organisation and enjoy setting up schedules. 
There is an inherent love of order and harmony. Because they push themselves

the proper balance. Libra natives have an innate sense of fairness, though,

dependent, insincere, lazy and self-indulgent. Libra natives are happiest 
when in partnership(s) or in situations where they can adjust or work with 
human relationships. Pleasant surroundings are vital to them. Libra natives 
find it virtually impossible to remain emotionally stable if there is 
discord around them. This leads to their wanting peace at any price, which

hardest problems for Libras to overcome. If they wait too long to make a

rigid that no amount of persuasion will make them change their minds. The 
scorpion sign is not to be messed with. Scorpio natives make friends with 
little effort and give unwaveringly to them. They are capable of extreme 
self-sacrifice for those they love. If anyone threatens their loved ones in 
any way, they feel that they, too, are being threatened. This threat causes 
them to strike out, either verbally or physically instinctively. Because a 
Scorpio’s unconscious mind is more in control than their conscious mind,

claustrophobia is why they are reluctant to get into total commitment

usually outspoken, sometimes to the point of bluntness. Just blurting out 
their ideas and opinions is due to their never-ending search for truth and 
wisdom. Others think Sagittarius natives are pretty insensitive and the 
statement that “truth hurts” fits their way of thinking. Some have reckless 
gambling tendencies and will bet it all on the drop of a hat. Travel and 
even long walks appeal to them because they make the Sagittarian feel free –

want to understand the broader issues and abstractions of life. They have a 
particular faith in higher things that generally always keep them of an 
optimistic bent, no matter what difficulties are currently besetting them. 
They want to understand the meaning of life. This desire for expansion can 
cause them to overextend themselves with too many activities and to use up

accurate conclusion. They usually get along well with others. They do not

than love or romance. For you to be happy, your mate must be your best 
friend and encourage your aspirations and ideals. You also need a great deal 
of emotional freedom and mobility. On the downside, you may be rather 
intolerant, closed-minded, dogmatic, arrogant, non-objective, risk-taking, 
or possess a holier-than-thou attitude """,

"Capricorn": """ If you have a Capricorn moon, (ruled by Saturn) you tend to 
be very serious and responsible, thinking that duty calls first before all 
else. You are not comfortable displaying your emotions for all to see and 
you certainly don’t want them to feel that you need help and support. You 
never want to appear emotionally weak. There is a great sense of ambition 
within you, perhaps because you feel unloved, unwanted or inadequate. You 
then work very hard because it makes you feel important or needed. You need 
to feel secure in your own authority. Security needs are what drive you. You 
may be shy and insecure about your own worth and can be overly sensitive to 
real or imagined hurts. Sometimes you feel as though you have to carry the 
weight of the world on your shoulders. You are especially uncomfortable with 
emotional dependency and will tell yourself and others (even children) not 
to be a “baby”. You need to accept that no one is self-sufficient all the 
time, and to be gentler with your “childish” emotional needs and wants. To 
others, you may appear to be rather hard-nosed and tough, with a 
businesslike attitude toward their personal concerns and feelings. Your 
feelings and loyalties run deep, but you often do not let people know how 
much you care. You also need to learn to relax, enjoy yourself, and play 
sometimes. You are conservative, reliable and ambitious. You can bring plans 
to completion. On the negative side, you may be ruthless in your desire for 
power and success. Selfishness and manipulation are possible. You desire 
recognition. The emotions are steady but can be quite cold. """,

"Aquarius": """ People with an Aquarius Moon sign have emotions that tend to 
be guided by intellect, and they can be very detached when it comes to 
dealing with them. Others may think they're cold and aloof because they 
don't understand their manner in how they deal with their feelings. This 
position steadies your emotions. They find security in dealing with and 
working with groups of people, especially in endeavours that benefit the 
majority. They are inventive, original, and progressive in thought and want 
to make the world a better place to live in. Family ties and attachments may 
not be as important to them as they are to others and they perhaps often 
consider their friends closer to them than their blood relatives. You need 
freedom and independence in their relationships with others. They back away 
at times if they get too close. They very much hate a partner who is jealous 
and possessive. They like to experiment and play the field. There is little 
affection for the conventional and the traditional. They tend to be 
friendly, intuitive, humane, progressive and independent. You are 
broad-minded with a desire to investigate all knowledge. They may have 
difficulty in understanding the emotional needs of others. At times you 
express unusual ideas merely to shock or surprise others out of their 
lethargy or just to see what kind of a reaction they'll get. On the negative 
side, they can be impersonal, stubborn, erratic, rebellious, rigid, 
emotionally cramped and selfish. """,

sympathetically and compassionately. You are sensitive, kind and gentle, 
imaginative, shy, tender-hearted, and have an innate understanding of how 
other people feel and react to situations. It hurts you if another is 
hurting or in pain. Because of your kindness and non-judgmental attitude, 
people in trouble, pain or confusion come to you hoping to find answers. It 
is difficult for them to think that you may be in pain yourself, but even if 
you are, you will do your best to help them or teach them. You seem to sense 
that all the pain you have suffered is for a higher purpose if only to teach 
others or help show them the way. At times, though, your soft-hearted is 
taken advantage of, and then you feel the need to withdraw, to regain your 
strength and composure. Music plays an integral part in your life, and you 
are instinctively drawn to it. It is as a voice from your spirit’s real 
home. It helps you to express the emotions within that sometimes are so 
nebulous or vague that they cannot be put into word. You have a very 
romantic nature and can fall in love with love. Sometimes your feelings and 
fantasies get so carried away that you become overly emotional or 
sentimental, much to the dismay of those around you. You have your moody 
spells that people do not know how to deal with. You are not afraid of 
challenging or hard work, and you especially like to work for those less 
fortunate than yourself. You prefer to work behind the scenes, as you may be 
quickly drained of energy by others. There may be talent in art, dancing or 
music. Tendencies to daydreaming may need to be controlled. """

patience and the ability to stick with things until the end. You may 
assimilate material at a slower pace than others, but once a concept is 
learned, it is never forgotten. You hate being forced or rushed into a

enjoy sustaining what others have started, especially if you can see 
tangible, practical results. You love to build things. You succeed not so

nervous energy. This can occasionally cause considerable mental distress for

would be Exercise. You are intelligent, witty, and always have a joke or 
comeback ready for any situation. You love the variety and doing multiple 
things at once, and this may be a problem. Too many irons in the fire at the 
same time. With this, you’re quick to grasp new concepts, yet you’re quick 
to lose interest in an idea, concept or project once your curiosity or 
thirst for knowledge has been satisfied. Mentally, you like to taste a 
little bit of everything, and so disciplined study and concentration are not 
your strong points. You are handy with your hands. You could be ambidextrous

you. You mercury in Gemini folk tend to scratch the surface with the things

jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none mental disposition. There is the danger, 
then, of superficiality. Controlling thoughts, words, and actions are 
necessary for you to be successful. It’s important to find your focus, stay 
with it and develop perseverance and discipline. Careers in Journalism, 
sales, advertising, speaking, teaching, or writing may appeal to you. With 
this mental restlessness, you may change jobs or locations frequently, or do 
work that involves movement, travel, and variety. You grasp concepts quickly

"Cancer": """ If you have Mercury in Cancer, your mind is connected with 
your memories, feelings, and emotions from the past. You tend to hold on to 
the memories of things because they give you security. You are highly 
interested in inner, subjective, and personal issues and your thinking is 
based more on feelings, intuition, personal experiences, and prejudices 
rather than reason or logic. Intellectual abilities and accomplishments 
without heart or soul mean little to you. You are a sensitive listener and 
genuinely interested in a person’s inner feelings and inner life. In 
addition to care and psychology, you could be drawn to education, art, 
poetry, music, or mythology. You can be shy and somewhat reluctant about 
speaking in public. However, you will open up and share your thoughts in 
intimate, small, little family-type circles of people you know and trust. 
You would perhaps enjoy keeping a diary or chronicle of your thoughts and 
feelings regarding your day-to-day happenings. Your mind retains and absorbs 
knowledge easily. Like most water signs, You are intuitive, empathic, 
psychic, and sympathetic, but yet may become insular and depressed about 
your own problems and the problems of the world in general. This can lead to 
difficulty in identifying the root cause of the problem because you easily 
become connected and involved emotionally with people instead of the issues. 
You may have difficulty in making decisions (because you make decisions

expressing them, through decision making. You take great pride in your mind,

know-it-all. You’ll need to watch a tendency towards false pride, 
intolerance, stubbornness, requiring an appreciation for everything you do

ideas and theories don’t interest them unless they are useful in a 
practical, tangible way. They love to analyse, measure and dissect 
everything, but perhaps they miss hints, nuances, and subtle shades of 
feeling and meaning. Their strengths are in their precise thinking, careful 
craftsmanship, and mastery of technical skills. They tend to be excellent at 
what you do and are critical of others’ work if it does not meet your high

about sex or death often. You seem to know things at an intuitive, nonverbal 
level and prefer learning through direct experience or apprenticeship rather 
than the hard time vicariously learning via books or lectures. You have 
mechanical ability and work well with your hands. You may develop healing 
ability through your hands. You are quick-witted, resourceful, shrewd, 
direct, sharp-tongued, and will readily say what is on your mind, in a most 
stinging manner. You enjoy satire and other forms of critical humour. You 
want to know everything while at the same time disclosing nothing to no one. 
You can penetrate beneath the surface of problems and people and understand 
them. You have sufficient manual dexterity with the capacity to repair

specific applications of them. Unless else supported in your birth chart, 
you are not inclined to focus on any one concrete or practical area. You’re 
not a fan of details, and often, you find it difficult to concentrate for 
long periods to carry your ideas through to completion. You seek mental 
freedom, yet these thoughts usually follow traditional lines. Having a 
natural gambling instinct (speculating and taking risks), you may enjoy 
enterprises and new ventures. You are forward, blunt and direct in your 
speech and you always speak your mind. People who know you know that you’re 
direct and you don’t beat around the bush. You say the first thing that

open and receptive to new technologies, scientific breakthroughs and the 
latest worldly discoveries in any field. You honestly believe that humanity 
can resolve their problems through its creative intelligence, via inventive 
minds and scientific principles. In fact, you're a bit impatient with those 
minds who are conservative, unimaginative and afraid perhaps to try new

You may lack a strong desire to work or to push yourself into doing anything 
that takes a lot of strength, organisation, patience, and responsibility. 
You are extremely sensitive to your environment, and thus you should be 
careful of which environments you hang around in. You can soak up energy 
like an energetic sponge. Your nerves and your mental health require you to 
rest away from the noise of the work-a-day world periodically. Take some 
time to be by yourself before you regroup and reconnect. However, too much 
time by yourself can be detrimental, as you have a tendency to get carried 
away with yourself and your problems. Healing through the laying on of hands 
or using visualisation techniques appeal to you. Likewise, you may have 
interests and natural talent in art, music, drama or poetry. You’re not keen 
on being pinned down by facts, and you prefer to follow your instinct rather 
than logic. Your intuition is strong, and you’re able to sense what others’ 
feelings and are, even before they even say anything to you. Often you’ll 
get so immersed in your own world of thought and imagination that you’ll 
overlook things in your immediate environment. You believe that anything is 
possible with that incredible open-mind of yours. To you, any intangible or 
spiritual force seems equally as real as anything in the real world, and

relationships. You need to be free to do whatever you want with whomever you 
like, and any infringement on that freedom will not be taken lightly. You 
desire an intellectual or spiritual connection with your partner. This may 
even be preferred over a very intimate or emotional bonding. You need a 
partner who provides plenty of freedom, allowing you to be your own person, 
and not be too demanding of you emotionally. You are original, happy and 
charming, but also, cool, calm and detached. This detachment benefits you

which make some overly dependent on you. You are very idealistic in matters 
of love, and this sometimes plays itself out whereby you become the martyr 
or the saviour in relationships. You’re more compassionate than passionate. 
You can become involved with others because they need to be loved or 
“saved”, and you want to help them, rather than being with them out of 
mutual attraction or pleasure. You tend to attract/are attracted to those 
who are imaginative, sensitive, musically or artistically inclined. You 
desire to find someone you can have a deep, spiritual relationship with. You 
idealise love and have a lovely, romantic vision of what love can be. At 
times you can just be in love with love. You may be highly emotional, 
perhaps overly so, sensitive, artistic, compassionate, gentle and psychic. 
You can be too easy-going or submissive and allow yourself to be taken 
advantage of because you do not want other people to feel let down and you 
don’t like to make waves. You may have the attitude that somehow you must 
suffer in love, and do so willingly. """

protective of what is yours (possessive), and you can be a sturdy defender

get into action (earth) so when you get mad, everyone can see it coming (or 
there may be a period of quiet while you build up steam and others may be 
surprised at your anger after this delay). While you are protective of what 
is yours, you may be very easy going about yourself, and almost never take 
offence (passive). Once you set your mind on a goal, your dedication, 
determination, and commitment to it are extraordinary. You’re in it for the 
long haul. You Mars in Taurus people are stubborn folk, and you never give 
up and find it difficult to change your mind or course in mid-stream. You 
are loyal to a fault unless someone betrays your trust, then all heck can 
break loose. You are patient and usually slow to anger unless someone takes 
you too far. That is when you charge, just like the bull Taurus stands for. 
You prefer a regular routine, with defined hours and clearly defined 
responsibilities and tasks. You enjoy building and seeing the results of 
your hard work. You need to see real results, not theory and you are not 
satisfied with intangibles like just having a good time. At the same time, 
you have a lazy, comfort-loving side and there is often a good deal of 
inertia for you to overcome before you get going. Keeping things going is 
your strength, especially once someone else starts them. Your stamina and 
persistence is your great strength, but it can also work against you; you 
can get caught in a rut and refuse to seize new opportunities. Change scares 
you. So does disease and pain. At times you have a decided stubborn streak 
where no one can reach you. Possessiveness and jealousy may cause problems 
for you in relationships. Money and possessions are important to you for the 
feelings of security they bring. Re-evaluate your values. Sharing should be 
cultivated. Your tongue may be quite unruly at times. """,

"Gemini": """ If you have Mars in Mercury sign-ruled Gemini, mentally and 
physically you are the busy, little bee. You are always on the go with many 
and various activities, often several at a time. You are happiest whilst 
you’re busy, and you hate boredom. Your mind is alert, active, and 
continually seeking to learn more. You absorb knowledge like a sponge, and 
love debate and argue with anyone who wants a mental sparring match. With 
Mars in Gemini, a lot of nervous tension or anxiety can exist with this 
position (depending on other planet placements), and it is essential that 
you get regular exercise to relieve the stress. You talk with your hands and 
maybe ambidextrous or have a natural mechanical ability. Develop patience 
and think before acting, so that you keep yourself out of trouble. It’s been 
known that sometimes you just do things for the sake of doing something, and 
this isn’t always a good idea. Learn to look before you leap. Travelling 
appeals to you because you never know what you’ll learn or who you’ll meet. 
You can accomplish multiple in short bursts, but projects or anything that 
require stamina, a long-term commitment and persistent effort are not easy 
for you. You’ll often scatter your energies into so many directions and 
activities at once that it can be difficult to finish or follow through on 
some of them. With Mars here being in a mutable sign, you need change, 
variety, and mental challenges. Your mind is sharp and alert, and you enjoy 
mental problems, competitions or games. Matching wits with someone brings 
out your competitive side. Mental banter suit you just fine. Your drive and 
energy are more mental than physical. You use your intelligence, wit, social 
sophistication, communication skills and awareness to achieve your goals. 
Humour and sarcasm come quickly to you. You need to learn how to conserve 
energy, so you don’t burn out and concentration so you will complete 
projects and carry through on promises. """,

"Cancer": """ If you have Mars in Cancer, you avoid direct confrontations 
with others, preferring to side-step issues or attack them indirectly. 
Aggressive, competitive behaviour makes you uncomfortable. Your ego drive is 
not too strong, and you are not extraordinarily eager or ambitious to push 
your way to the top. Inner satisfaction and contentment are more important 
to you. You may feel uncomfortable or inadequate in situations that call for 
robust and forceful action. But, when you feel your loved ones, friends or 
family are being threatened, then you will defend and fight for them with 
all the tenacity in the world. Being the ‘moon sign’, this brings outs a 
sensitive side to the action taking and powerful protective side in you. 
Impulses and instincts take over, and you will battle until the end if 
needed. Being ruled by the Moon, you cancer people have your goals and 
actions centre around your family and loved ones, and they are very 
personal. Great sacrifices can be made for them, even though they may be in 
the wrong. Being sensitive to stress, you do not handle high-pressure, 
competitive situations very well. You can be very touchy, moody, irritable 
and difficult to be around when there are many demands or tensions at work. 
Your energy level is not constant and is very dependent on your emotional 
state at the time, especially as regards your emotional harmony or discord 
at home. You should avoid eating when emotionally upset as this plays havoc 
with your digestive system. You are hard-working, sympathetic, moody, 
defensive, tenacious, intuitive, instinctive, sensitive, and perhaps 
over-emotional. Control of your emotions is vital to your health and 
well-being. """,

"Leo": """ Mars in Leo people are often proud and subconsciously probably 
have an ego. If you have this placement, you’ll want to excel, to stand out

so, it can be difficult for you to take orders or to stay in the background. 
You want to be noticed. It’s known that will dramatically do things just to 
be seen and get attention. You hate to be wrong and may insist that you are 
always right. You are strong, energetic, forceful, determined, artistically 
creative, and highly competitive. You like to play hard, you play to win, 
and you won’t give up easily. On some level, maybe you see life similar to a 
competitive sport, performance or game. You love applause and admiration, 
and you have a strong sense of personal honour and integrity. You tend to be 
very self-confident, maybe even a little arrogant. But you may become 
self-conscious, defensive, and somewhat belligerent if your self-confidence 
is shaken. You tend to be enthusiastic, somewhat impulsive, full of energy, 
and ambitious. You are fixed and resourceful in matters of love and will 
pursue your love interest with great fervour and passion, letting nothing 
get in the way of your desires. You don’t beat around the bush, but say 
exactly what you feel, often in an embarrassing direct way. On the negative 
side, there may be a love of taking risks or of gambling. You can be 
quarrelsome, argumentative and jealous. There may be heart trouble if 
physical activity is overdone when you are not in shape or if anger is 
allowed to vent destructively. Energy and passion both need to be 
disciplined. You need to be admired for your actions. """,

"Virgo": """ If you have Mars in Virgo, you are an energetic worker, a 
perfectionist, and you have high standards for your work. You often feel 
that if you want something done right, then you must do it yourself, for 
others never do as thorough a job as you do. Doing a task well is crucial to 
you, and you may labour over minute details that others wouldn’t bother 
with. You continuously work for efficiency, accuracy, and precision. You 
become irritated when things are not done “right”. However, you can become 
so self-critical and drown in perfectionism, that you don’t even attempt 
many activities and projects from feelings that your efforts just won’t be 
good enough for you. You are usually very realistic in assessing what you 
can accomplish and, if anything, you underestimate yourself. You are good at 
conserving your energy and pacing yourself so that you do not waste or 
diffuse your efforts. Sometimes an unwillingness to take risks or venture 
from the tried, beaten track can sometimes limit your opportunities. You may 
not aim high enough and may settle for too little in life. You can be a 
worry-wart and a fussbudget who gets lost in too many details. """,

"Libra": """ If you have Mars in Libra, you swing from being too pushy, 
aggressive, confrontational, and insistent on doing things your own way to 
being too eager to please and too compromising. You have a strong attraction 
to the opposite sex, and if Mars is well aspected, then this brings 
popularity and goodwill. But if Mars is badly aspected, then this can bring 
opposition and criticism from the public and the opposite sex, fickleness in 
love relationships, and trouble from toying with the affections of others. 
You go swing back and forth between the desire for competition and 
cooperation. You continuously seek an internal balance between acting 
independently and assertively and working cooperatively and interdependently 
with others. You can feel frustrated at times that you cannot just do what 
you want to. Internally you’re always accommodating the needs and desires of 
others. Perhaps you feel hesitant to act in a positive, assertive manner if 
you feel you don’t have the approval and support of other people. It’s safe 
to say, you’re not a loner. You achieve your goals by joining forces, 
collaborating with others and being a team player. You are very concerned 
with concepts of fairness, and you can become quite vocal if you sense 
someone is being taken advantage of or mistreated in any way. You may be 
attracted to legal pursuits. You avoid extremes and favour a balanced, 
moderate approach to living life. You’re not the type of person to push 
yourself too hard or to become fanatically driven to reach your goals unless 
pointed out elsewhere in your chart. You tend to be perceptive, persuasive, 
perceptive, enthusiastic and easygoing, although at times you can be 
argumentative. Diplomacy and patients may need to be cultivated. """,

"Scorpio": """ If you have Mars in Scorpio, you are incredibly 
strong-willed, and you pursue your goals and desires with passionate 
dedication and determination. You are capable of total concentration and 
tremendous discipline. Influencing you once your mind is made up is

almost obsessed with it. You tend to be secretive, and you do not want 
others to know what your plans are. You tend to be instinctive, perceptive, 
determined, strong-willed, stubborn and magnetic. You have deep emotions and 
may occasionally show a primitive side. You need to learn self-discipline or 
your desire nature will rule your life, probably causing great sorrow in the 
end. You must learn to control your jealousy and possessiveness in matters 
of love. A certain amount of detachment in relationships would probably be 
right and this, of course, would include your tendency to treat loved ones 
as possessions. You are very forceful quietly and subtly, and other people 
may struggle to see or understand your motives. You’re able to manipulate 
people in a way that is not obvious to them or others. Direct confrontations 
with other people are not your style. You prefer to operate behind the 
scenes. Either way, you are a formidable opponent when riled. """,

"Sagittarius": """ If you have Mars in Jupiter-ruled Sagittarius, you are 
enterprising, aspiring, idealistic, and forever following some bright and 
distant star, planning new ventures or investigating new potentials that 
will expand your horizons. You aim high and are not content merely with a 
quiet, secure existence. You are a rolling stone. You like to stretch your 
limits, to see how far you can go, and to take risks. You are a positive 
thinker, expect success for yourself, and are philosophical about failures. 
You are flexible and bounce back from disappointment rather quickly, usually 
with another hopeful new idea you want to try. Your enthusiasm and 
confidence are contagious and enable you to enlist the aid and support you 
need for your projects. However, you sometimes promise more than you can 
deliver, due to over-optimism or insufficient attention to the 
practicalities involved. You also tend to get distracted and sometimes have 
too many things going at once. Although it may be tough for you, there are 
times when you must only develop and show commitment, perseverance, and 
persistence to make your dreams and goals a concrete reality. Too often you 
fall short of what you could attain because you are unwilling to persist 
through the difficult or less exciting times. You also enjoy competition and 
usually do not take it too seriously. You tend to be friendly, optimistic, 
impulsive, enthusiastic, independent and argumentative. You may be an active 
traveller. Use your energies in physical outlets, and you may be an athlete. 
You have a tendency to exaggerate. You may also have strong religious and 
philosophic convictions and can go “crusading” if you feel the cause is 
just. On the downside, you may be sharp-tongued, quarrelsome, disagreeable, 
self-righteous, verbose, intolerant, and dishonest. """,

"Capricorn": """ When you have Mars in Saturn-ruled Capricorn, your actions 
serve your ambitions for recognition, distinction, power, and status. You 
are not content to follow in life. In most areas, you want to have a leading 
role in whatever you do. If you do not manage or handle that energy well, it 
can make you appear manipulative, ruthless and bull-dozing over anyone who 
stands in your way. You are organised, efficient, tenacious, dedicated, 
steadfast, practical and disciplined in your pursuit to feel or be 
successful. Your drive and energy are directed towards practical material 
accomplishments and achieving concrete results. You are hard-working and 
willing to bypass immediate comfort to achieve your long-range goals. With 
Mars in Capricorn, you can quickly become a workaholic. You’re very 
conscientious about doing a thorough job and responsible enough to see it 
through. You don’t gamble or take risks when it comes to implementing your 
plans. You prefer the conservative, tried-and-true route of doing things and 
then following through with it. You rely on your own perseverance and effort 
rather than good luck or fortune. There are a natural shrewdness and 
instinct for business or organisational management. You tend to be 
ambitious, patient, self-reliant, persistent, and responsible. You could be 
seen as a slow learner, but there is a total assimilation of knowledge. Your 
energy is carefully used. Success is important to you. On the negative side, 
you may have quick irritability which needs to be controlled and a tendency 
to feel resentment toward others for supposed hurts. You need to learn how 
to forgive and forget and how to release your emotions and frustrations 
positively. """,

"Aquarius": """ If you have Mars in Aquarius, your energies are expressed in 
unique and original ways. There may be a genius streak shown in the way you 
approach things. You are a bit eccentric, unconventional, inventive, 
scientific and perhaps a bit rebellious. Working with and collaborating with 
others to get things done appeals to you. You enjoy taking part in social, 
group activities and uniting with others with whom have similar ideas and 
persuasions. You are democratic, progressive, and not concerned with hogging 
personal power or having authority over other people. You're more of a team 
player. New, inventive and unusual methods of technology, planning and work 
are of great appeal. Your energy levels usually are quite high, but they can 
be erratic at times. You tend to work in short spurts. Thus, you can be 
inconstant and impatient in pursuing your desires. With Aquarius being ruled 
by Uranus, you are intellectual, cautious, independent, freedom-loving and 
enterprising. You respond well to emergencies. There may be interests in 
mechanical or scientific subjects. Science fiction may intrigue you. You may

some instances haste does make waste. On the negative side, you can be too 
aggressive, quarrelsome, contentious and perverse. """,

"Pisces": """ If you have Mars in Pisces, your energies and aggression

others is more your preferred style. In your pursuit of something, you’re 
more likely to give up something rather than to fight for it. Your ego is 
not especially interested in glorification, material advantage, personal 
achievement, or winning at the expense of someone else. Because of this, you 
may come across to others as weak-willed or ineffectual. Being on top, the 
best or first has little importance to you. You’re just as happy in a 
supporting role, working for the benefit of others or for a cause that you 
believe in. With your Mars being ruled by Neptune, you may experience 
difficulties in planning clear and definite goals for yourself in the real 
world. You are not sure what you want out of life, except you instinctively 
seem to know that you do have and need to find a spiritual purpose. You have 
many dreams, high ideals, and a strong mystical or religious impulse. You 
also have a creative imagination and can successfully apply yourself to art 
or music. You are intuitive, humorous and diplomatic, quiet on the outside, 
but restless within. On the negative side, you can be indecisive, 
procrastinating, too interested in the sensual side of life, and may resort 
to using drugs or alcohol as a way to escape the pressures and 
responsibilities of dealing with everyday life. Learning self-control is 
crucial for you. Take action, don’t only day-dream. """

be terrified of acting like Aries, but this is what you need to deal with 
learning. The best quality of Saturn is a system, and the best quality of 
Aries is leadership. With Saturn in Aries, they can be a competent leader. 
This is someone who is not afraid of going out and doing it no matter what 
it takes or how long it takes. Saturn’s worst quality is selfishness, and 
Aries worst quality is interference with the plans of others. They’re also 
capable of meddling and trying to run the affairs of others. They may run 
roughshod over them in trying to get them to do their will rather than their 
own. They can be a real slave-driver. They dislike restraint of any kind and 
do not take kindly to others telling their pioneering, self-starting 
efforts. Freedom comes only with responsibility and discipline. Feelings of 
being inadequate may spur them on to tackle enormous undertakings to feel 
more valued or worthy. Stress from trying to accomplish too much may make 
them ill. """,

"Taurus": """ You may be slow to start speaking and slow in speaking, 
although when you talk, you usually have something worth listening to 
(Saturn, Earth, Taurus). You are trustworthy and loyal (fixed sign). You 
have a strong reluctance to change (enduring earth) and are hard to move 
from a position once adopted. You are very possessive and may be miserly. 
You may, however, be quite happy if you have somewhere to live, the clothes 
on your back, and a few dollars in the bank. In this case, you will appear 
non-materialistic. But you must have this minimum. If you have Saturn in 
Taurus, you are very persistent in carrying out your goals. You can be 
overly concerned with material possessions and in wanting to squirrel away 
too much for that proverbial rainy day. You tend to place too much emphasis 
on material goods and possessions for security and if carried too far, you 
can become miserly and miserable due to worrying about what might happen 
tomorrow and will you have enough money to cover things. You need to 
re-evaluate your values and the source of real security. On the positive 
side, you are a tireless worker and have patience, caution, determination, 
discipline, organising ability and can go the distance when those around you 
fall. Hard work is your forte. Your feelings are serious, well-controlled 
and not easily changed, although at times it may be hard for you to forgive 
and forget. Loyalty is important to you. Building structures that last is a 
need you have. """,

"Gemini": """ If you have Saturn in Gemini, your thinking is deliberate and 
serious, and you possess organisation skills, concentration and mental 
stability. You can focus on deep and complicated matters and come up with 
practical solutions to problems. You enjoy learning. But there may also be 
tendencies towards cynicism, depression, and pessimism. Nervous tension can 
be a problem and the intake of air into the lungs, or the oxygenation of the 
blood can be restricted. Your lungs need plenty of oxygen. It is best for 
you to sleep in a well-ventilated room. Saturn here steadies your mind and 
helps control the natural flightiness of Gemini. This is a good position for 
Saturn, but you may need to develop faith in the future. It will be vital 
for you to discipline your mind and learn to think and act methodically if 
you are to be successful in anything. """,

"Cancer": """ You seek control concerning your home and family instinctively 
and protectively. You feel safe and secure as long as your home is OK. You 
work hard for your family and home. You use your home to create good 
feelings and security. You are restricted somewhat by your past. You may 
feel guilty about the past or your family. You may feel moody or melancholic 
when what you consider to be your roots are threatened. This may mean you 
are patriotic. If you have Saturn in Moon sign-led Cancer, you are 
protective and persevering, and you worry over loved ones. You can be moody, 
fearful and insecure perhaps because you feel unloved, probably by one or 
both parents. These feelings may bring on within you feelings of inadequacy 
toward your own ability to be a parent. As a parent, you may be very 
demanding and a strict disciplinarian to your children. Emotional depression 
is something you need to conquer. Your unconscious fear of being hurt by 
others can cause you to withdraw from too close an emotional involvement 
with others. You are kind but may lack empathy. You can be so busy 
protecting yourself from hurts that you are unable to see the hurts of 
others. There is a tendency for improper digestion due to the lack of 
certain digestive juices in the stomach. It would be best if you did not 
drink liquids with your meals (except milk, which is food). There is a need 
to curb the appetite, as it can get you into trouble. Land and property may 
give you emotional security and alleviate feelings of not having something 
to fall back on. """,

"Leo": """ If you have Saturn in Leo, you possess diplomatic, organising, 
executive, and leadership ability along with a strong will. You tend to be 
self-reliant, conservative, and are incredibly efficient. You may have 
difficulty expressing your emotions and your affections, which may make you 
appear cold and unloving. You need love, but may not know how to go about 
giving or receiving it; thus you may isolate yourself from others. Your love 
is motivated by intense feelings of duty and responsibility, and you show 
your love and appreciation by taking care of business and doing what is 
required or by giving material things to loved ones instead of yourself, 
which is what they really want. On the negative side, you may be cruel and 
quick-tempered, jealous, and may resort to underhanded means to satisfy your

may be mechanically oriented, and you are resourceful, even under the most 
adverse circumstances, patient and persistent. The action and energy of Mars 
combine with the forethought of Saturn in a most excellent combination. 
Whatever you do is done with intensity. On the downside, though, there is a 
danger of stubbornness, revenge, lack of forgiveness, resentment, and 
ruthlessness. Tendencies to grub for money and prestige can cause harm. 
There can be health problems with constipation or haemorrhoids. There is a 
need to transform your desires. You need to learn when and how to let go.

intuitive, philosophical, independent and persistent. Mental maturity comes 
later in life and promises success. You are generous with a wonderfully 
developed sense of responsibility. You have administrative and scientific 
abilities. A benefit can be gained from meditation and introspection. You 
may have poor circulation in the hips and legs. You need physical exercise

critical to you. You understand that time and suffering serve a purpose and 
that happiness is not the final goal of existence. You may find it difficult 
to divide your energies between work and play. You can translate abstract 
concepts into concrete terms. You may experience feelings of loneliness and 
inadequacy, and that could be one reason why you tend to work so much time

You can exercise system, organisation, discipline and tact in unusual and 
non- traditional ways. You can think ahead and plan things with an inventive 
flair. Seeing things in a whole new approach is one of your strengths. You 
tend to be serious, impersonal, detached and scientific. On the negative 
side, you can be opinionated, vindictive, cold and uncaring with a tendency 
to get quite aggravated if your plans are met with opposition. """,

"Pisces": """ If you have Saturn in Neptune-ruled Pisces, it may be

getting lost in the shuffle of everyday life, and it may be hard for you to 
keep your touch on the pulse of things around you. Sometimes you just get 
lost in the fog and can’t see your way clearly. You are intuitive, 
sympathetic, sensitive, imaginative and self-sacrificing. You are a 
practical idealist and have a tendency to take life perhaps too seriously. 
You may have the sense that your present life’s troubles are due to actions 
from the past. And this is probably the truth. You must reap what you have 
sown in previous lives, and Saturn comes to exact his payment. Perhaps this 
is why you tend to feel more sorrow, perhaps, than the usual person. There 
could be some success in working behind the scenes, away from the public 
eye, possibly doing research or working in institutions. On the negative 
side, you can be indecisive and moody, with a tendency to react emotionally 
to unfavourable conditions or people. Depression can set in if success 
escapes you or if you feel that you have been unfairly treated. You need to 
develop faith in the future and let go of the past. Dis-identifying from 
other people’s troubles will allow you to help them in their own sorrows.

soul growth. """

house1 = { "Aries": """ The first house in Aries — a man of this type rushes 
forward with great energy and strength. His confidence helps in the 
implementation of all plans. He is enthusiastic and eager to excel in 
everything that he can do. He does not want to lose a single minute of his 
time just like that. His place in life is not easy, because he knocks it out 
aggressively and courageously. Any tasks that life throws up to him, he 
takes with enthusiasm and optimism. The first house in Aries gives a great 
desire to prove itself, and at any cost. Such a person is ready to argue and 
fight, being sure that only in this way, one can assert himself. In the 
event that there are unexpected obstacles or obstacles that take away his 
strength, he intends to expend all his energy to the end in order to achieve 
success and get the desired result. Peace for him is like death! A great 
desire to entice the rest for themselves. Such a person is characterized by 
a fairly active attitude toward his initiated business. He vigorously grasps 
at any business, passionately trying to occupy all the key positions, 
completely and completely plunge into the turbulent flow of events. 
Character traits are clearly manifested, and very pronounced. Such a person 
is strongly influenced by the first impression. If he is in a good mood, 
then the power of his influence on the world is huge enough and few people 
will be able to resist him. This is an open, sincere, simple-minded and 
trusting person. If he feels safe and yet can remain open, he will be simply 
irresistible and charming. Everything expresses quite sharply, all its 
antipathies and sympathies. The fact that it does not fit, he simply 
destroys by any means. He needs to try to balance the relationship on the 
principle of Libra, and for this you need to learn the tactics of your 
enemies and learn all the best. It is necessary to strengthen in itself such 
an important quality as the ability to remain calm and impartial. Staying at 
the same versatile, focusing on the aesthetic principles of balance and 
harmony. If such a person finds himself in a deadlock situation, he easily 
falls into depression, becomes at the same time — boring and listless. This 
person really needs support, because his energy is not enough for him. He is 
very restless by nature, and his approach to the whole world is more direct 
than diplomatic. It can irritate the surrounding people with its dynamism, 
aggressiveness and sociability. He is able to defend and defend his views, 
using for this purpose mental faculties. It’s always easy to get started, 
but it’s hard to finish it - it soon gets bored with it, so it switches to 
something else. It is very important to develop consistency in yourself.""",

"Taurus": """ If first house in Taurus — this means that this person invests 
his time and energy in all profitable enterprises. He loves all aspects of 
life and loves to create cosiness and beauty with his creativity. He 
actively strives for comfort and security. In interpersonal relations is 
prone to courtesy of culture and decency. Seriously refers to personal 
relationships and is concerned about their strength, however, as well as the 
quality of business relations. Very helpful in handling, and this helps to 
eliminate rather complex obstacles in its path. Sometimes it acts very 
harshly, but still respects the rules of decency. The main thing is not to 
talk about his own security, personal or financial interests, and so may 
even be compliant. In all his relations and deeds he strives with all his 
might to order and a quiet future. It strives and achieves its goal, and 
treats all its started affairs calmly, stably starting and finishing them. 
Creative growth and work on changing one’s personality are carried out 
step-by-step and step-by-step. In his character, the main qualities are 
hardness and rationalism. In everything, he trusts only his own experience. 
Development of this type of personality occurs if there is a condition for 
obtaining all guarantees of its security, reliability and concreteness of 
the total achieved. The character of a man with 1 house in Taurus is very 
stable, strong and slow-moving, hence — not inclined to various changes. 
Always looking for logic and trying to explain everything that happens. 
Likes to plan and create. All his affairs, this person takes with 
responsibility and with pleasure brings them to the logical end. This type 
of person is somewhat lazy and inert. He considers it necessary to react 
only to what seems to be either significant or significant to him. But he 
expresses, he expresses only that which actually really bothers him or his 
feelings. On the path of such a person it is better not to become, for he 
expresses himself very impressive, and sometimes simply threatening. In a 
situation where he is not confident enough, he, most likely, will remain 
silent, rather than discuss his concerns and concerns with others. Self 
perception and self-expression are somewhat constrained and limited. Such a 
person is inclined and difficult to learn, but what he learned — learns for 
good and uses knowledge and skills more efficiently than others. He needs to 
overcome the dogmatic nature of perception, while focusing on the activities 
of his enemies, which are obtained precisely where there is a lack of 
attention in the perception, speed or mobility of the reaction during the 
expression of all their thoughts, emotions and feelings. In any case, such a 
person simply needs to move away from ordinary materialism in perception, as 
well as naive realism in his self-expression. This person is quite calm and 
quiet. And to understand something or accept a new one, it needs some time. 
However, if he learns something, it is unlikely to forget it. Such a person 
very rarely praises, never does and does not make any hasty judgments. He 
knows the value of money, in vain they will not spend. Sometimes it is lazy 
or somewhat inert. He always seeks the meaning of life and wants to 
understand, to realize the vital value. And when he understands, it follows 
her hard until the very end. I like expensive jewelry and quality 
clothes.""",

"Gemini": """ The first house in Gemini means that such a person is 
different, both by his intellectual abilities and by the individuality of 
his creative thinking. Such a person is able to formulate all his thoughts 
reasonably, brightly and logically, since he himself often becomes like his 
ideas and fantasies. He perfectly corresponds to an excellent intellectual 
form of self-perception or self-expression. A man with 1st house in Gemini 
is eloquent and talkative. He quite actively seeks to communicate, wishing 
at the same time to speak out to the end and at the same time, as versatile 
as possible. Such a person is very appreciative of light humor, ingenuity, 
lightness and intellectual strength. It is simple enough, it finds a way to 
the human soul and establishes an interconnection with any human being. In 
his studies, he does not strive for consistency, solidity, accuracy and 
order. In connections and contacts with people, it is also not permanent. 
Without much difficulty, he draws others to joint successes, but at the same 
time he quickly and easily switches to another job. To everything, this 
person is suitable simply, even a little thoughtlessly. Although it develops 
well in a variety of ways and in any environment, even in an atmosphere 
saturated with a lot of information, in an environment where communication 
and contacts are constant. The character is easy, changeable and elusive. 
All the new cases he undertakes only as a result of contacts with other 
people. Always addresses the initiative to the surrounding people. This 
person always lively grasps at any undertaking and quite simply refuses it, 
debugging this unfinished work aside. Such a person often fusses a lot, 
constantly mastering the newest forms of perception or self-expression, so 
easily abandoning those that he acquired earlier. Such a person reacts very 
sharply to all new thoughts and sudden information. He is sufficiently 
sensitive to any movements, changes or movements. It is difficult for him to 
sharpen his interest in something inexpressive, because for this it is 
necessary — to concentrate, ponder or delve into the subject. A person is 
intelligent with a mental character of expressing thoughts and also with an 
excellent ability of mental perception. Knowledge is given very easily, and 
usually he remembers everything on the fly. He often becomes bored, if 
suddenly there is no one to talk to. This type is sad without new 
acquaintances or without news and vivid events — in ostentatious life or in 
the intellectual sphere. It happens that he makes an impression of the cold 
and dry personality on those around him, as all his sensations are 
transmitted by mental constructions or social stamps. Conversational speech 
is reasonable, and all intonations are not accompanied by living feelings or 
anxieties. This person always models both the external and the mental world 
in the appropriate forms, and therefore some things do not understand and 
simply do not absorb, and others greatly distorts. The development of this 
personality is directed along the line of deepening of thinking (without it, 
it may well remain banally flat) and mastering the essential (and not 
mental) awareness of ideas that inspire a person to self-improvement. He 
simply needs to learn how to feel the boundaries of mental analysis and not 
allow the spread of energy ideas and unforced emotional impressions to the 
spheres. Changeable and perfectly adapts to all situations. Always 
delicately feels all the practical usefulness of things, and displays them 
in good ways in people, their good sides. Try not to be rude or assertive. 
Enough many faces. He needs to focus and not succumb to impulsive actions. 
It is easy and fast in communicating with the surrounding people. It happens 
too talkative, so it may even become a talented narrator.""",

"Cancer": """ The first house in Cancer means that such a person differs in 
uncertainty, but with a passion for his feelings. His emotions are always 
reinforced by the will. The form of individual manifestation is necessarily 
connected with the family and relations with their relatives. Such a person 
wants to be far-sighted everywhere and always. He is too cautious, more 
likely even shy in contact with the world around him, and in fact he is very 
receptive to him. Of course, he just wants to join in here completely. The 
surrounding world, this person comprehends, as a flair, and own experience. 
He is more to hear than to speak. It responds to the current mood, others 
perceive it as capriciousness. But in fact, in difficult moments, this 
person reacts quickly and clearly with courage. He has an amazing gift to 
find friends and acquaintances in his environment. It is easy enough to 
become attached to them. As a person, very inspiring, sensitive and plastic. 
He is too cautious approach to the choice of their affairs and easily 
submissive to influence. Very capable, but these abilities are very 
versatile, and are hidden deep enough, and therefore they are not easy to 
update. For such a person, the inner touch of his talents is much more 
important than their public disclosure and demonstration to outsiders. He 
does not want to share his experience and knowledge, he prefers this wealth 
to himself. He loves to be in the thick of things and wants to take all the 
key positions. The nature is clearly visible. Such a person has a rare gift 
— to listen, but to talk and talk for a long time - no. He is extremely 
sensitive, vulnerable to self-perception, often confused and gives himself 
up, while with great difficulty expressing himself and his inner sensations. 
But it’s all this you need to learn. According to others — this is a closed 
and silent person, but this is only the appearance. In fact, an emotional, 
deep and informative person. In the appearance of this person it is 
impossible to understand even the mood — whether he hears you and agrees 
with you or not, condemns or approves. On his face you can not understand 
what he thinks and what he is up to. True, quite often he simply does not 
think about anything, since his inner thoughts hardly reach his 
consciousness and are re-formed into words. Hence — a strong dependence and 
constant readiness for self-defense against all any new impressions, which 
is the basis of all self-deceptions or distorted expression of his "I". To 
protect oneself from enemies, such a person must learn to be practical, 
persistent and purposeful in his work. On this issue you need to work, 
especially on yourself, because it is necessary to eliminate all distortions 
of emotional perception and self-expression. All the emotions of this 
personality need to be made even more essential and learn how to properly 
submit oneself — correctly, accurately and sincerely. In addition, it must 
be remembered that the stage of ruthlessness of enemies is determined by the 
size of their own egoism. This type is very attached to his home and to his 
mother. Patriot of the country and an adherent of all traditions. Collects 
collections, rare things and often remembers the past. He has an excellent 
imagination, but is shy in essence, and for a harmonious life he needs love 
and constant support. But because of innate fear, I have to hide from 
troubles. His manners are graceful and a kind of charm, but in case of 
threat or discomfort, they go inside themselves. Sensitive, so predisposed 
to the influence of others.""",

"Leo": """ The first house in Leo, which means that such a person is full of 
dignity, will and energy. Often a person is arrogant. Intervenes without 
permission into other people’s affairs, when he is absolutely not asked 
about it and speaks when he wants. Expressed the desire to show oneself as a 
very strong and self-sufficient person, self-confident, with pronounced 
qualities of the leader. There is a tendency to laziness and idleness. 
People are treated with arrogance, although they themselves always need a 
worthy attention and the best place. They are always cheerful and adore 
demonstrating their vitality to others. To all their affairs started, they 
are quite stormy, very active, sharp and even authoritative, and for all 
important things they take with a spark and a great desire. They like to 
bring everything started to the logical end. The character is stable, 
durable, does not change under the influence. He likes to express an opinion 
or consistent logical arguments. Self-expression and perception are bright 
and somewhat dramatic. This type of real actor, accustomed to the applause 
of his fans. Such a person perceives himself and the whole world to a 
considerable extent, through rapid flows of energy, volitional onslaught, 
frenzied enthusiasm and a whole storm of emotions. If you want to get 
attention from such a person — dress brighter, lift your head, straighten 
your back and sparkle with admiration at the sight of its virtues. It is 
important — if you notice that in a conversation with you, such a person 
stoops, or looks away, this means that you are simply indifferent to him, 
and maybe even he is afraid of you. This extraordinary personality is given 
power over others and the ability to control the inner state of a person. 
But such abilities are very difficult to dispose of wisely and tactfully, 
because he is inclined to get very involved, both with his energy, and with 
power over people. Forgets about their emotions and the need to look at 
themselves or their actions objectively. But in the absence of such an 
objective attention to yourself — such a person may well become a conceit or 
a stupid despot. In this case, his inventive enemies (Aquarius sooner) will 
want to use his vanity. This is a very strong personality, dominating the 
others. An idealist and a sincere romantic. If he can not learn magnanimity, 
he will be a stubborn egotist. Proud and very self-centered. He loves 
admiration and applause in his address. But sometimes, others do not even 
know what to expect from it, because behavior varies in a fairly wide range: 
from restraint to excessive temper.""",

"Virgo": """ The first house in Virgo — such a person is inclined to 
manifest extreme principles. In the development or implementation of any 
ideas, he acts systematically, consistently and systematically. He 
painstakingly remembers every detail and accurately analyzes everything, 
which is the main reason for success in his actions. The goal of a man with 
1st house in Virgo is perfection. Quality is much more valuable to them. 
Such people tend to have a reasonable relationship with the surrounding 
people. They can always be trusted, because they undertake to do only real 
things. And all the promises they made, they intend to perform accurately 
and even scrupulously. Are inclined to sharp or sharp criticism, all of them 
noticed inconsistencies. Criticism is perceived in a personal address very 
calmly and cold-bloodedly. Everything that such a person does is extremely 
important for him. And therefore, all this he wants to master firmly and 
reliably, and also to have guarantees of a long-term connection with exactly 
what he wants and will do. To all his new affairs, this person is very 
serious and wants to act stably, in the direction of the task. Own 
personality completely changes and does it in stages. The character of this 
person is firm, concrete and rational. Development occurs on the basis of 
personal trust, rendered only to personal experience. Personality is easy to 
learn. Such a person is not free, he always finds something to do. Always 
feels that you need to bring order, coziness and cleanliness everywhere, but 
this is quite a troublesome business, even if you confine yourself to the 
closest environment. Quite often, such individuals are unhappy with 
themselves or with surrounding people. If something is going wrong with 
them, they simply can not enjoy life. But such a person can see and 
appreciate all the charm of small details (and the external material world 
and its own internal). Such a person likes to bring his skills to 
perfection, and therefore perfectly copes with various work that requires 
thoroughness. These people are often lost in some situations that require a 
rare skill — it is great to evaluate any circumstances, having on that 
incomplete information. Synthesis is given to this person with difficulty, 
and when perceiving or expressing itself there is some difficulty with 
imagination. He can too literally (and therefore sometimes wrong) understand 
everything. He expresses his emotions and feelings too precisely, which do 
not endure analysis and can not even reveal themselves, manifest themselves. 
A fairly sensible and enterprising person, prone to pedantry and 
organization. It happens that it often tires himself of worrying about 
nonessential things. He knows the secret of eternal youth. He himself 
actively uses the ability to notice weaknesses in other people, although he 
does it quite correctly and diplomatically. Maybe even a cloak or a whiner. 
Often such people become comedians or commentators. His mind is so 
perceptive that it helps to determine the cause that has influenced the 
perfection of the personality of other people. In addition, it can establish 
their weaknesses.""",

"Libra": """ The first house in Libra means that the identity of such a 
person is most pronounced during cooperation with others. In others, he 
discovers the focus of personal reflection and recognizes himself through 
the reaction of the surrounding people to him. The actions of this person 
give the impression of grace and beauty combined with a sense of 
responsibility, discipline and rigor. The best quality of these people is 
the ability to enter the position of another, and also to understand his 
position. They do not endure isolation, and alone from others, feel helpless 
and lost. They seek a harmonious and even relationship with others. 
Cultural, diplomatic, polite, have a great sense of tact and the same values 
in others. People with 1st house in Libra have an excellent taste, and all 
the time are in search of and fulfilling an honest partnership, and full 
friendship. They love graceful things and in their everyday life 
unconsciously strive for beauty and convenience. Their perception seems 
unbiased, although in reality it is simply due to social norms. Personality 
is perfectly coordinated with generally accepted ways of perception, 
attitudes and views. Self-perception of this person is highly aesthetic — he 
always and always wants to see himself attractive, in accordance with his 
internal state and the surrounding world. True, this harmony is accepted by 
him in a greater degree spiritually, with the help of rationalizations, 
therefore, significant mental self-deceptions are very characteristic. This 
person seeks to immediately eliminate disharmony and restore justice. And 
for this, first, he should learn how to correctly detect real imbalances: 
you need to discover and establish your personal internal balance, and only 
then try to influence the external reality. A similar kind of internal 
search is not easy, they can not be expressed in acceptable social terms. 
That is why these people are often engaged in the external world, guided by 
traditional aesthetics and widespread ethics, which do not fit well with 
their personal inner insights. Hence — wonderful frustrations, in which this 
person feels himself not in person and in place, but also in public life. 
But it is clear where this sensation comes from, he does not want and is 
satisfied with distorted rationalizations. The direction of finding the 
truth, he will show enemies who need to learn decisiveness and sincerity. He 
is tactful, sociable and friendly. Substantial results will be achieved only 
through cooperation. He sees in everything both negative and positive sides, 
because of this, it turns out to be indecisive and with an effort comes to 
the final point of view. At an elderly age can suffer excessive weight. 
Beautiful, has a charm, wants to be loved. Constantly stretches to bring 
everything to the intellectual and emotional balance.""",

"Scorpio": """ The first house in Scorpio means that this person manifests 
himself in a strong-willed, energetic, invariably ready for a huge risk for 
the sake of achieving a dream. It is useless to explain the impossibility of 
his intentions and the impracticability of goals — he either perishes, or 
achieves his. His pursuit of the goal, strengthened by a strong 
determination and warmed by intense feelings. The desire to implement 
personal plans is so intense that it awakens the ability to reveal reserve 
sources of opportunities and forces. A man with 1st house in Scorpio is 
vigorously involved in the events of his life spanning him. And at the same 
time he never gives himself up for the sake of external victory, the 
identity of a personal person and the peculiarity of self-perception. If he 
expresses his antipathies and sympathies, he is always direct, concrete and 
clear. Often can not cope with himself, as inclined to a restless response 
to various obstacles that arise on the way to achieving a dream. He explores 
the problem of interest to him thoroughly and boldly. This person is very 
biased about the inner and outer world. On an ultra-high level, this all 
manifests itself in high self-discipline, as well as calm tolerance for 
others. On a simple — in the form of acute pity for himself and a fairly 
emotional self-justification and full condemnation of the world in various 
acute situations. Feelings and experiences so sharply traumatize this 
person, that to be objective in relation to himself it is rather difficult. 
He is able to dispel illusions and self-deception only with heavy and long 
efforts, with humility, meeting the inactive pragmatism of partners and the 
Taurus heaviness of enemies. This person has a sharp and sharp radiation of 
a sexual nature, accurately cutting the aura defense of neighboring people, 
forcing them to react to such a person emotionally and strongly. He should 
learn restraint in the expression of feelings and remember that for him 
compassion for himself is harmful, but selfishness is bottomless. The 
success of self-perception on a low level is connected with the number of 
devastations in the world and, of course, the frustrations and desperation 
of neighboring people, which bring great emotional satisfaction to this 
person. He must strive to transform the simplest motives into superhigh 
aspirations, and this transformation must follow the path of internal 
alchemisation of thoughts and drives, with high self-discipline and 
self-control, in various acute situations. It’s not easy to recognize, 
because there are quite a lot of things hiding under the exterior. Often 
behaves like a simple and calm person, in the very depths of which, is an 
exceptionally complex creature, much more receptive and sensitive than it 
may first appear. He has a great endurance and strong will. He is cautious, 
reserved and secretive. Instills others with respect for their ability to 
understand things in their deep essence and integrity. Has a sharp tongue, 
so often offends others, inciting them to detachment.""",

"Sagittarius": """ The first house in Sagittarius means that such a person 
stands out with optimism, affability, some patronage and interest. His 
ambition is aimed at superhigh goals. He constantly thinks only of himself 
and, in addition, is inclined to accept everything as an ordinary 
phenomenon. He is able to assure others of the personal correctness and 
validity of his views of the work, which is very useful for him. His 
optimism is the strongest source of inspiration for those who communicate 
with him and feel his influence on himself. This person passionately pursues 
the realization of the meaning of life. He is friendly and cheerful. 
Surrounding people perceive him as a communicative adventurer, sense and 
novelty, rather inclined to adventure. In dealing with people, he is a bit 
arrogant, but he is always ready to help with deed and word. In life, this 
person is trying to take a leading and leading position. He sets his 
principles and principles firmly and militarily. But thus, always remains 
the knight, that speaks about its moral-spiritual maturity. His good nature 
is slightly rude, he is always of good intentions and is full of 
friendliness. The world perceives energetically through the prism of 
transcendent ideals and higher aspirations. On himself and on existence, 
such a person tends to look optimistically, without delaying his attention 
on the negative sides. A person with a house in Sagittarius always finds a 
way out of difficult situations and recommends everything to everyone — not 
to lose faith in any way. It is understandable, because he himself is always 
lucky. Careful looking after him suggests that such a person is rather 
insensitive (with all sorts of versatile charms). However, this is not so — 
he just expresses himself energetically and cheerfully, and strong emotions 
and various kinds of mental nuances — he does not like. Often, he makes many 
falls in love, so around him there is always a lot of people of the opposite 
sex. Perfection of the person, means elimination of superficiality, 
impermanence, false and excessive enthusiasm. This is helped very well by a 
mental analysis of perceived circumstances and own self-expression, to which 
this person needs to learn from partners and enemies. There is always a 
strong temptation to run away from internal problems or project them 
outward. If this person takes up his self-improvement, then, of course, with 
all energy and determination. However, his frank enthusiasm can soon cool 
down, which, accordingly, will lead to switching to another object. He wants 
freedom of thought, action and word. Carefree, optimistic and friendly. An 
idealist with a developed flair, interested in spirituality in all its 
forms. A brave and generous man, easily excited and talking a lot. His joy 
attracts the interest of others, so he is rarely seen in the crowd.""",

"Capricorn": """ The first house in Capricorn — people with extremely 
characteristic systematic and disciplined work, remarkable persistence and 
ability to work hard and long. Everything that such a person does is 
invariably filled with meaning and is aimed at implementing, albeit a 
distant and high, but practical and concrete goal. Such a person is always 
serious, sober, reserved and melancholy. For such people, the desire is 
inherent in the desire for personal efforts to rise above others and the 
desire for ambitious intentions. In all their victories, they make all bets 
only on their own strengths and their characteristic skills. For them, there 
is a special "peasant grasp" — for the conquered bridgeheads they hold to 
the last, tenaciously. Such a person can quickly and without excessive noise 
reach quite a lot, persistently and steadily climbing the steps of the life 
ladder. Often people with 1 house in Capricorn are born directors and 
managers, referring to everyone as managers and managers. This thoughtful 
person is not inclined to give up on trifles. He feels that he is capable of 
much, if he makes something his main goal. True, when choosing a goal, these 
people are often capricious, because his goal must be both concrete and very 
worthwhile, and not that there will be no satisfaction with its achievement. 
Self-perception is specific and strict, and minor flaws and troubles are not 
taken into account. At a low level of development, it is an eternally 
unsatisfied and dull individual, who does not believe in anything and hangs 
about from business to work, without any hope of victory. Internal work, by 
all means requires this person constant and long-term efforts. He will not 
otherwise develop the hardness of character, as well as the ability to wait 
patiently for a long time and patiently. Often, he learns to arbitrarily 
change the hope for a sense of duty. At superhigh development these people 
speak little and without affectation, however their speeches sound like 
prophecies or immutable truths, which often appear. This man must overcome 
in himself the general dryness of manners, distrustfulness and indifference 
to everyday attire, which in his life plays a much greater role than he 
thinks. Enemies teach him to look deep into the essence and take into 
account the emotional states of other people, which he himself is inclined 
to forget. In his youth, he does not stand out for strong health. An 
ambitious and hardworking figure, for whom the achievement of result on the 
material plane is of great importance. He feels the need to see certain 
results of his efforts. Constant and patient. Has a developed sense of 
personal dignity, can be too disciplined and very one-sided. Everyone treats 
him with extreme seriousness. His actions are cold and restrained. Childhood 
is unlikely to have gone easily, but it has started to look younger with 
age.""",

"Aquarius": """ The first house in Aquarius means that such a person is 
original, inspired by many desires and creatively independent. He wants to 
invest in a common cause, he loves contacts, jokes, pleasures. Modest, dear, 
does not like to attract excessive attention to himself. He wants to be 
loved, not just admired by his abilities. He draws strength through 
participation in collective activities within a close circle of friends. A 
person with 1st house in Aquarius actively reaches out to everything 
unconventional, and also willingly takes part in reforming the ways and 
styles. He is motivated by the usual installation. For him it is obvious — 
"the world exists only to change it." He likes to lead people around him 
into a shocked state of excitement, trying to form an opinion of himself, as 
a fairly uncommon person — either a magician or a magician. He perceives the 
whole world and himself mentally-detached. He is very interested in original 
people and thoughts, from which they can be heard. With the development of 
such a person acquires a rather unusual outlook on the outside world, often 
not consistent with the generally established. Independence and freedom of 
personal self-expression is not a whim for him, but an urgent need for life, 
that’s why to him, and it’s not easy to live with. He often confuses love 
with friendship, but he does not like to break off relations at all and 
always tries, even at parting, to remain on good terms with his 
acquaintances. He often creates a cold impression, it’s just that he does 
not have the usual habit of expressing feelings: with a beloved being he is 
inclined to appeal friendly, and gives smart books, not flowers. This 
person, constantly does not like reality — he is dissatisfied with himself 
and the world. At superhigh development, his personality can skillfully 
carry out mental original ideas to change both the internal and external 
reality. At the lowest level — an eccentric who does not understand anything 
either in this universe or in himself, but eager for an empty dream and 
adoring to stubborn in his unsuccessful finds. Unpredictably freedom-loving 
and self-confident. Enjoys the fact that stands out from the rest, sometimes 
unconcealed proud of his individualism, however, really wants to please 
others more than others. People are seen as moving and attractive. Always 
seeks to change the existing situation. Recommended exercise in physical 
exercises, because he has a tendency to stop blood circulation.""",

"Pisces": """ The first house in Pisces is a compassionate and sensitive

inexplicable insight gives him the opportunity to intuitively understand the 
nature of a person. He has a strong musical and artistic talent. Such people 
tend to sacrifice in relation to the world around them, which is expressed 
in active service to the rest or passive martyrdom. They are distinguished 
by a strong sensitivity to external stimuli. Far from it often, they can 
rely on personal strength, but constantly strive to help others. The people 
around them often consider them to be detached from everyday reality. People 
with 1 house in Pisces are distinguished by an excellent development of 
understanding and perception of mythological, religious and mystical 
problems. They tend to be in a world of illusions and dreams for a long 
time. They like to gain strength from sentimental experiences and romantic 
images. To a stressful, depressing and oppressive environment, they adapt 
with considerable difficulty. Prone to embellish the difficulties of this 
everyday life. Such a person, with a high development, is able to acquire 
true wisdom and, thanks to the perception of life at an ultrahigh level, 
follow the principle of not resisting evil. He is obliged for this to accept 
both the world and himself, as they are, looking at what is happening with 
objective attentiveness. With a low development, these people produce a 
rather amorphous impression. Many people seem to be manipulating them, 
deliberately subjugating their own will. Such people like to complain about 
their lives, and also get sympathy from the rest, regardless of the nature 
of their complaints — they are rarely condemned and almost always feel 
sorry. This aspect tells a person a huge emotional sensitivity and 
sensitivity to the pains and experiences of others. Protection from such 
irritants is self-deception and lie. For the self-expression of these 
people, emotional stormy outbursts are typical, through which it is 
difficult to discern something real. As usual, these people are kind-hearted 
and kind in reasonable limits. They have an enveloping and delicate 
perception, instinctively shy away from sharp angles and try not to notice 
them in themselves and the world. For them, it is very valuable to work out 
honesty, which can be achieved through orientation to the vital moments 
emphasized by the enemies. They should strive to imitate their enemies 
accurately and scrupulously, grounding all their low sensitive states, by 
which they mechanically try to occupy both the inner and outer life. This 
person does not have a huge physical energy, is able to borrow power from 
the highest sources, through concentrated intuition. Restrained, 
compassionate, dreamy, quiet and calm. He prefers not to meet with bad luck 
face to face. At the threat of loss, he does not try to correct the 
situation, because he is not sure of the success. Effectively uses the 
healing musical potential, is able, with its support, to overcome even the 
most unpleasant moods. At any event reacts very emotionally.""",

ingenuity in his attempts to hide it. The environment for this person is 
divided into two types — well-wishers and enemies. With the first, the

and generous. For the latter, it is dangerous in its rage, thoughtless and 
impulsive, destructive primarily for itself. But always this person avoids 
ambiguity and lies, with him one can be sure of the sincerity of everything 
that he does and says. Difficulties in communicating with such a person 
consist in the fact that it can not be changed by logical arguments and 
arguments. Stubbornness and impulsive haste make this person act rashly, 
sometimes leading to irreparable consequences. This person often experiences 
financial difficulties due to his lack of economy and his unwillingness to 
obey the order and planning. Although for inner peace and confidence to this 
person it is vital to have some reserve of funds for the future, otherwise 
he loses ground under his feet and begins to commit even more ill-considered 
actions. He should learn to restrain his emotional impulses and connect to 
his financial projects thoughtful and rational partners. This person has an 
excellent ability to open new horizons and overcome new heights, but he

professionally made things, especially when it comes to the instrument for 
his professional activities. For such a person, there is no difficulty in a 
long, monotonous and laborious work. He is quite inactive, avoids boiling 
energy and actively minded people. It is lost when it is necessary to take 
momentary decisions, at the same time it is hardworking and fulfilling, it

useful proposals in every aspect of his life. He does not like to limit 
himself to one direction, he always seeks and finds additional sources of 
income. Somewhat superficial, in communicating to others it is guided by 
mental rather than rational considerations. A person is active, energetic, 
eagerly interested in everything that happens around in order to obtain new 
information. He does not tolerate stability and a long stay in one place. 
The desire for change often pushes him to travel, and sometimes to change 
his place of residence. Quickly satiated with a monotonous reality, without 
emotional recharge, falls into depression, becomes irritable and morose. To 
deduce from a depressive state of this person it is possible only with the 
help of new information and change of surrounding scenery. It is a logician 
who has a sober mind and some uncompromising attitude in his convictions. To 
persuade him to change his mind requires long persuasion, backed by material 
arguments. Often it happens that the person persuading him himself falls 
under the influence of the person in the 2nd house in Gemini and changes his 
own plans and attitudes, adjusting to the requirements of this person. For a 
more harmonious development, a person with a second home in Gemini should

directing his energy to satisfaction of proprietary instincts and earning 
capital. Despite his ability to benefit, this person is panic-stricken with 
poverty and seeks to consolidate his financial position with all his 
strength. In dealing with people, he is emotionally affectionate, striving 
to literally absorb the energy and emotions of close people. In general, 
this person has a very developed instinct of the owner, he seeks to possess 
all at once and many, and the thought of spending his capital leads him to 
confusion. His world is clearly divided into two parts — that he is pleased 
and that he is surprised and irritates. From the second part of his life he 
tries to fence himself off, hiding himself as if he were a shell, striving 
unconsciously to erase unpleasant phenomena for himself, even from his own 
thoughts. When confronted with the idea of the indivisibility of the 
surrounding world and realizes the need for coexistence with unpleasant 
phenomena, it falls into despair. This person has to learn to coexist, 
painfully rewriting his own ideas about the right and wrong, pleasant and 
useless. His emotional instability can lead to disorientation and loss of 
his own ideas about the surrounding reality. For the harmonious development

misanthrope, not interested in anything and no one, can develop in this 
person. With positive development, such a person on the contrary becomes 
caring, attentive, but at the same time somewhat bustling and intrusive. A 
sort of distant relative, somewhat awkward, but hospitable and trying to 
please everyone as much as possible. If necessary, this person can take an 
unprecedented step and completely get rid of the accumulated good. However,

trust of high-ranking individuals. Having powerful patrons, he himself 
strives for the same position and quickly achieves his goal, occupying high 
positions. The earnings are stable, which gives him moral stability and calm 
confidence in his position. To those around him who are at a lower level, 
they are disgusted, believing that inferior people are not worthy of his 
attention, and they should not stand on ceremony with them. With a negative 
development, such people get satraps-conquerors, cruel and unprincipled, who 
know neither pity nor respect. The only thing that can stop such a person is 
the idea that another force, more threatening and powerful, can be found on 
his strength. Therefore, this person tries to suppress in the bud all ideas 
that can lead to the emergence and development of such a force. With the 
surrounding world, such a person builds a fairly simple relationship, which

in conjunction with other people. For him, the world is simple and 
monotonous, he believes only in what is able to understand or perceive at 
the physical level. Money earns easily, but the craving for luxury and rash 
extravagance can ruin it. For greater confidence and harmony, this person 
should learn to be objective, able to perceive the personal qualities of

quite actively, and is engaged in all family affairs quite intensely and 
enthusiastically. In a home environment — intellectual work is very fond of 
doing. It matters to him what kind of relationship will be with family 
members. In general, relatives close to such an individual are a field of 
audits of all his ideas, constitute a certain circle in which it is quite 
possible to speculate or exchange opinions. But his opinion does not change. 
Life positions are rational, therefore they are more directed to the 
features of the world order. For a given person, the thought is important in 
itself, but the interaction with it is not an easy task, because it is 
generated in the depth of the essence, and then suddenly floats out, taking 
on the appearance of quite adequate words. Religiousness of such an 
individual is exclusively mental, and this does not prevent it from becoming 
sublime, since communication with the Supreme is highly intellectual. It 
happens that this person in different situations can pronounce different, 
completely opposite in their meaning texts, which emphasize his life 
positions, and can perceive them as confirmation of their positions. The 
house has a lot of books, and various magazines, there is always a radio and 
a TV. His close talkers and clever, and it happens that interferes with deep

huge emotional satisfaction. Quite often, he works exactly within his own 
home and creates everything with great pleasure. Maintains wonderful 
relationships with all family members and family members. To everything, it 
is enough tied to affairs of the house. Always supports any family or family 
traditions. Negatively accepts changes in the home way of life.

This is a religious person, therefore all life and all positions are based 
on the Most High, therefore, the voice of God for him sounds like a 
beautiful melody, pouring from the depths of his own soul. He believes that 
God watches all his inner state and personally influences his life 
positions. This affects his daily routine.

If the development of character is low, such an individual is formed by 
concrete circumstances from outside life and by the public subconscious. 
Such a person even realizes what exactly causes his behavior. In the simple 
version, it sounds like this: sneak up, quickly grab everything that lies 
badly and drag it into your hole.

Perhaps the development of selfishness, as an excuse — a thinly developed 
sensitivity to anxieties, dangers and unpredictability. The development of 
certain positions must necessarily be carried out for his purposes, which 
destiny presents individuals and, for the sake of achieving them, a resolute 
sacrifice and a certain asceticism are required.

The house of such an individual is cozy and beautiful, something like a 
fairy-tale cave in a certain kingdom — most likely, a sense of security, 
some kind of isolation from the outside world. Getting here, you feel the 
fence from external reality. It is impossible to understand family problems 
here, since they are closely connected with the life of past generations.

A man with a 4th house in Cancer is quite emotional and sentimental, adheres 
to all traditions. Very much in need of strong kinship roots, although it is 
likely that at a young age can leave his father’s house. Parents have a 
moral impact on such a person. There is a possibility of development of some 
hereditary diseases. It is necessary to pay attention to this!

Such an individual is inclined to take care of relatives and condescends to 
misunderstandings of a different kind. If there is a choice, then with great 
pleasure will live in an old parental home. Marriage without love does not 
interest him, so it is likely that in that case, celibacy can be chosen.""",

the self-expression of such a person. He exposes his home for show and 
openly shows his life level and his own opportunities and achievements. He 
takes guests with pleasure, gives gifts and treats. A house for such a 
person is a matter of pride, like a palace and in it, he is a ruler. I like 
to demonstrate the achieved standard of living. She loves to arrange in her 
own home demonstration techniques. In all household affairs invests a lot of 
strength, finance and personal energy.

The life criteria of a person with a 4th house in Leo are energetic, 
consistent. He lives with the inner feeling that life is like a battle, and 
the whole world for him is a battlefield. But it is difficult for him to 
understand the nuances: who, when and with whom he is at war. The main 
problem is for him to choose the means by which he wishes to use himself, 
including the assertions of his own life-setting. He is just deliberately 
waiting for confirmation of their correctness.

In prayerful meditation with the Almighty, such a person receives a colossal 
charge of emotion and enthusiasm. This shows him the right way for his 
future life. All vital positions are often and vigorously manifested 
outside, both in consciousness and in direct actions. It is extremely 
important that the process is sufficiently controlled, otherwise the 
programs of all behavior change. This person will cool logic, like Aquarius.

With a rather low development of character — a person becomes a domestic 
tyrant. He wants to have constant power over his household, he wants to be 
afraid of evens the sound of his steps. And from his house there is a 
feeling of triumph of power and suppression of the life of others.

He loves to organize demonstration techniques, even if he does not have the 
financial opportunity for this. In the house seeks to have all the best. He 
always tries to believe in himself, fueling this faith with positive 
examples. In the parents’ house there is always a cosiness and a lively, 
harmonious atmosphere. The head of the family, as a rule, is a strong 
person, but is inclined to dramatize any situation. Children are very 
important for such people, and in old age will willingly help them 
financially. Mother, very bright person in this house. Most often, she 
continues to be together in the same house, until the very end.""",

or criticism in dealing with issues.

Such people are energetic and always on the move. Waiting for guests? Hence, 
this person wants to know the exact amount of financial losses. In all 
matters, they thoroughly understand, want to diligently study up to the 
smallest details. If suddenly, something happens to be not in the designated 
place, they find fault with their home. They tend to cling to any irrelevant 
details and permanently get stuck in them.

Often such a type, all his life proves to others and himself, his absolute 
rightness, and all his powers are lost to him. In development, it is 
necessary to move away from the very idea of consumption of the world — to 
the idea of an important creation, and the creation of a thorough and 
sufficiently detailed one. Religious feelings are almost always estimated as 
a kind of satisfaction with personal achievements and work. This person 
communicates with the Creator through the forms with which he always 
interacts during life.

The house of the man with the 4th house in Virgo is always decorated with 
little things that delight the eye, but there are no useless things here, 
only purely useful and functional. H about the pantry a lot of unnecessary 
items, and collected from all edges of the world, just in case. In the 
fridge there are enough excellent products — the family is not deprived of 
it. Relations between relatives and friends are sufficiently caring. But 
there are likely small quarrels or misunderstandings. It is necessary and 
important — to dry up (emotionally) the mood with energy of all-pervading 
love, and without it, all life simply loses its meaning and wears out 
quickly enough.

Childhood of this individual was distinguished by the lack of wealth, but an 
overabundance of uncertainty or instability. All memories are associated 
with a sense of loneliness and abandonment. Such a person has a feeling that 
parents in his childhood did not like him and did not care properly. It is 
difficult for him to make important decisions, and his life is ready to give 
to the family and tries to serve her until the very end. Even after serving 
a term and retiring, such a person continues to work vigorously, because it 
can allow them to maintain and restore their spiritual youth.""",

emotional balance is viewed as a criterion of the effectiveness of diligence

coordinated with the public understanding and are oriented towards common

understanding of their real life positions. All this, he constantly needs to

often insists on their authenticity, not refusing to explicitly violate all 
those around him for the assertion of personal correctness. His house, this

throws out. He often moves his furniture in anger and fundamentally 
rearranges the interior. This person demands that his family develop all the

sexual plan associated with a partner in marriage is particularly acute. He 
has strong and deep feelings and applies his super bright impressions to 
persuade the rest. Parents did not differ exceptional care and intuition, so

in life, using energy and pressure. True, this often leaves a person alone,

defeated purely magically, for example, by setting itself external specific

compromising family secret is not ruled out. Sometimes they embrace sadness

falls into spiritual loneliness. The personal home plays a big role and is a 
refuge from the outside world, in which it can make up for the activity lost 
in external activities."""

it as something responsible and important, tries to perform its duties as 
qualitatively as possible. When he does not manage to cope with them, it is 
hard to fail. Several such cases can well develop in it a complex of 
professional inferiority.

Disillusionment in one’s own forces can cause indifference to the results of 
one’s labor, which in turn leads to dishonesty and loss of meaning in life. 
Thus, success in the work has a strong influence on the emotional state of 
such a person.

He subtly perceives the signals that his body sends him, and at times he 
suffers from excessive suspiciousness. He feels well, being in a state of 
equilibrium, when all the organs and systems of his body maintain a state of 
stability and well-being in him. In this state, he positively perceives the 
world around him, which appears before him in a bright light. It is not 
recommended either an overabundance of feelings, or an emotional vacuum. Too

In the working environment, they are determined to win leadership, claiming 
authoritative positions.

They hardly focus their attention on one functional duty, alternating 
several types of work in one day, otherwise their productivity tends to 
zero. The state of the body leaves much to be desired. Health disorders 
often have a psychomotor nature, although often these people simply feign 
illness to attract attention and empathize with other people. To work 
productively, they need energy and inspiration. The most suitable for them 
is activity, where a tangible manifestation of power is possible.

If the energy flow is running low, it is perceived as a complete collapse 
and the reason for changing the scope of activity. However, it is difficult 
to master a new working direction, because you need to spend a lot of effort 
to learn new skills, and people of this kind need unconditional submission. 
They earnestly defend their labor achievements. They dream of world 
recognition and worthy encouragement of their work.

interest in work is exhausted even before its completion: sometimes due to 
lack of time, at times the interest in the results of labor is simply lost; 
it happens that the process hinders the need to find out all the details.

Such people can start acting in a certain mood. Taking on any task, they 
clearly feel their responsibility. They rarely cross the boundaries of 
service relations. They are very responsible for issues related to rational 
nutrition and a healthy lifestyle. These people tend to master new tools in 
order to fully reveal their functionality. They receive an incomparable 
pleasure from working out small details, grinding and bringing the subject 
to perfection.

Often a person with a 6 house in Virgo throws a job unfinished precisely 
because he can not stop working through details. Low development leads to 
the fact that he is completely indifferent to work because of the inability 
to complete what he started: he is burdened by the feeling that the work 
will never end. If there is a high development, a person becomes a 
professional in his business, most responsibly suitable to the task.

People of this type feel healthy if they are firmly convinced that their 
body is in an ideal condition: in order to be sure of this, they regularly 
review their language, check for fresh breath and monitor the uninterrupted 
operation of all body systems. In addition, they consider themselves to be 
excellent diagnosticians, periodically discovering various diseases and 
abnormalities. Every day choosing food or caring for a diet in case of 
illness, they rely entirely on their intuition. The most effective means to 
overcome the disease are, as a rule, mud baths, infusions of grasses and 
other methods peculiar to the elements of the Earth.

in small things. He may be interested in scientific developments, dietology 
and mechanics. Such people have a natural craving for historical sciences, 
structuring and ordering. Despite his impatience and nervousness, he is 
ready to come to the aid of all the suffering. Its energy requires a decent

health and causing feelings of dissatisfaction. It is necessary to monitor 
the diet in order to avoid serious problems with the liver and digestive 
tract.""",

services; in work they achieve success when they can count on support and 
participation from the outside. Work in the team seems to be the best option 
for them. In general, financial viability is impossible without the 
participation of a partner.

They can achieve great success in matters requiring courteous attitude, tact 
and courtesy. Having reached senior positions, these people try to 
objectively treat surrounding people regardless of rank, communicating with 
their subordinates on an equal footing. They are very free to eat; the 
availability of useful products for them is not so important as a beautiful 
serving of dishes.

People with the 6th house in Libra give much importance to the aesthetic 
side of the work. Everything they do must look beautiful; The process itself

workers. They are graceful and elegant, easily involved in the work process, 
perform work at ease and easily. Such people feel good when nothing breaks 
from inner balance and peace of mind. They feel healthy, if their way of 
thinking does not contradict the accepted rules, that is, the activity of 
the mind should not go beyond the limits of permitted norms.

An important factor of mental health is social acceptability. If it is not 
accepted in society, a person falls into despair. Here fresh air and 
aesthetic needs will come to the rescue. It happens that the rejection of 
one’s own body, caused by implanting unattainable ideals, can lead to 
serious psychosomatic illnesses. It is important for such people to realize 
that their bodies are just a tool that can be used beautifully, and they do 
not have to answer anybody’s aesthetic demands. Even the most beautiful hand 
can not always reproduce a beautiful gesture.

When the situation at work leaves much to be desired, they do not seek to 
establish relations with colleagues, although communicating with them can 
bring them benefits, and they are always happy to help others. Provided that 
the work delivers to this person pleasure, he will put all the forces for 
its successful fulfillment. But routine negates its potential; he urgently 
needs a change of impressions. It can attract activities that require an 
individual and purely creative approach. It can be fine art or literature. A 
disregard for one’s own health threatens with diseases associated with 
kidney failure.""",

use them, but at the same time he is ready to hate them when he does not

directness.

condescendingly, because he uses all his mighty power and calm confidence to 
protect people close to him.

Opponents, as he sees it, sometimes tear it apart. Therefore, it is very 
difficult to decide on the resistance and is in combat readiness. This type 
of person, can not accurately determine the strengths or weaknesses of 
enemies. It is not easy for him to understand that both the opponent and his 
partner can differ completely from himself, because he is inclined to 
translate into his own ideas about himself. He sometimes lacks the 
imagination to understand — enemies and companions are also people with 
their emotional lives.

Relations with your partners and associates are cool and dry. External 
caring or attentiveness to some problems, sometimes comes to a bore, only 
occasionally accompanied by warm emotions and genuine participation. His 
responsibilities from the task common to the companion, this subject singles 
out carefully enough and always strives to fulfill them more accurately. 
Sometimes, the common cause gets stuck in small details, sometimes of a 
purely material nature.

indefinitely find out their relationship, thereby irritating the spouse and 
leading him into despair. Often close people treat them as demanding. And 
the solution to all these problems is to work on yourself. But, despite the 
innate compassion and some kind of isolation of this person, it may well

critical criticism. From his partner, this subject is waiting for 
reliability, and therefore sometimes early enters into a relationship.

expecting much to receive in return. Then, as such a person becomes master 
of the art of bestowal, he will become happy. This aspect is suitable for

pragmatists. They always strive for equilibrium in any relationship with 
their enemies or in harmony with their partners. For their enemies they need 
to learn the objectivity and elegance of versatility. It is very important 
to overcome in oneself this disparaging attitude towards all your enemies, 
both internal and external.

In relations with their partners, there is often a lot of gossip and talk, 
for example: about the fair and proper distribution of their duties, spheres 
of influence and responsibility. There is such a tendency as to shy away 
from work, but to this person it always seems that his partners actually do 
so.

Only with sufficient high development — relations are established fairly

yesterday’s opponent tomorrow may well turn out to be an excellent partner. 
And such a companion relationship, this subject often falls into various 
emotional extremes, from suspicion to anger, and at the same time tries to 
manipulate other people. Very often the relationship is broken for a long 
time in order to then resume at a different level. He needs to protect his 
partner from the ostentatious world, and not pinch him at any opportunity. 
Then the partners will be sufficiently responsible and reliable.

In a marriage, these people are usually very jealous, both sexually and 
socially, can not tolerate any friends of their spouse. This is a very 
complex style of marriage relations and it requires a high degree of 
intimacy. This is achieved by great difficulty, and all the time is

religious-philosophical advantages of the companion. Their connections with 
the society are stable and harmonious, and they usually choose partners as 
pleasant, promising and reliable. In general, all their connections — from 
family to political — are formed, usually, successfully, although all this 
does not eliminate the possibility of a second marriage.

If you need to part with someone, then this person tries not to continue the 
business to the true gap, but he knows how to save a pleasant relationship 
in the future. In the partnership and partner relations, he tries to lead 
the others behind him, even if it requires him to take on a share of their 
workload.

People with the 7th house in Sagittarius are usually law-abiding, when the 
situation does not suit them at all, they tend to change the laws 
themselves. This is a strong, accurate, intrepid and fast warrior, which 
causes enemies to feel an overwhelming fear. At low development, he is 
inclined to be praised by exaggerated and imaginary triumphs over enemies. 
His enemies, although numerous, but still rarely hit the target, only 
succeeding in charting for the person the course in which he is obliged to 
strengthen his defense. As a partner, he is cheerful, pleasant, optimistic 
and cheerful, sometimes very much.

Such a person is inclined to take a lot on himself. He always strives to 
fulfill his promises to the others. If this fails, he quietly writes off the 
failure on objective circumstances or transforms cares for a partner. In 
general, with him is better in fun than in sadness. With such a loved one, 
it’s hard to miss. He constantly laughs and rejoices at the return of the 
spouse to the dwelling, which is very adorned by the marriage union. True, 
in difficult moments there is clearly a lack of judgment, but in moments of 
conflict, the conflict may turn out to be more traumatic than either of them 
would like. He is so curious, friendly and expressive that he sincerely 
adores many people, that’s why it’s hard for him to love one person.

He does not want to limit himself and bind himself. The more freedom he has 
in his marriage, the more he will be happy, and the longer the marriage will 
last. Probably several marriages. Friendship is more important than sex and 
love, and he will appreciate that partner who understands this. If he 
manages to find a real partner and does not go early to the marriage union, 
he will idealize the person with whom he cohabits, and will try to please 
him in everything.""",

"Capricorn": """ The seventh house in Capricorn means that such a person in 
communication and alliances enters cautiously and with restraint. With a 
large congestion of a multi-audience, he becomes shy. The congestion of 
people horrifying him, so he avoids such conditions, preferring small in 
terms of the number of participants in the company. All contracts he carries 
out through proxies, the number of which is strictly limited.

In a marriage, people with the 7th house in Capricorn usually come late, 
carefully and carefully, having weighed all the "cons" and "pros". Happens 
in a non-free life they are connected for reasons of prestige. In conjugal 
relationships, consistently and thoroughly built, such people try to 
strengthen their spiritual, social and financial situation.

Enemies of this person come across solid, serious and practical. They are 
not in a hurry, but they also do not miss a good opportunity to carry out 
their hostile action. This is all they need to learn, overcoming their own 
natural vulnerability and inherent emotional susceptibility. In combat, this 
person lacks imagination, he shows excessive asceticism and high 
practicality, he is too mundane imagining his opponent. Perhaps the 
emergence of a persistent terror against the enemy, or a misconception about 
his omnipotence.

Often these people, deep in their souls, are afraid of their enemies and 
suddenly give up positions when the enemy is ready for an exhausting and 
long struggle. Often such people are good tacticians and fine strategists, 
however, laziness will prevent them from applying all these abilities. In 
relations with partners they are cold and somewhat reserved, prim and 
practical, laconic and economical. They almost always prefer to concede 
direct companions to their companions, and they do not hurry to accept the 
views of their colleagues — they just put up with them, and then only for a 
while.

Probable partners such people choose for a long time and conduct through all 
sorts of trials. They are located to pay attention to the outer, and not to 
the spiritual dignity of the neighbor. Obviously, they lack emotionality in 
intimate relationships, so living with them is a bit boring, if only they do 
not work purposefully and consciously.

Such a person is looking for an adult partner who could teach his 
determination in himself. But here in the resolution of heart questions is 
not particularly open. He wants to be loved, but he doubts the naturalness 
of the confessions of his neighbors. It is not easy for him to take and give 
at the same time. If someone frankly offers him his love, he is inclined to 
hide his feelings, for him the choice is not easy.

A late marriage union is possible, aspiration to find a mature partner is 
expressed. If the role of guardian and defender is formed, it can even come 
to a young partner. This person is inclined to at least somehow restrain his 
partner, or he feels himself to be limited, due to any fundamental duty to 
another person.""",

"Aquarius": """ The seventh house in Aquarius means, in a marriage union 
with a partner, these people need some independence. Entering into all sorts

of freedom for themselves. To people, in general, are good, willingly 
worried about others. They instinctively try to occupy the main place in the 
union, for example, at the expense of all that are constantly ready to help 
others.

In marriage — a person with a 7th house in Aquarius, without a good reason, 
constantly wants to know everything about everything and everyone that 
happens in family life. Sometimes from one time the family life of this 
person does not add up. In general, all of its partnerships are built not on 
mutual dependence and the power of the ostentation, but on friendly and free 
grounds, which in our time is not so easy to establish. Sometimes such a 
person simply crosses the law, and even without noticing it.

The enemies of this man are usually resourceful and intelligent, like 
himself. True, in the battle and him, and they lack the consistency and 
practicality in combat battles. They rather lead the battle of the 
intellects and the battle of minds, rather than the physical battle. The 
main thing in a clash is to win the disagreement through extraordinary 
ingenuity and greater insight. With high growth, such a person is fighting 
on the side of the camp of the future with dying pieces of the past.

In battles with opponents, these people fly in the clouds, because of which 
their defense and attack are ineffective. The main thing for them is to 
track and identify the internal causes of their failures and to find means 
for a duel with rivals. Then the enemies weaken and lose their activity by 
themselves.

Such a person loves wise partners, full of unexpected thoughts. During the 
cooperation, he loves not so much to solve specific problems, how to 
determine them and come up with ways to solve them. He establishes strong 
friendships with his companions, which often causes misunderstanding on the 
side of the partner in marriage. Willingly admits he is in love, but most 
often he understands something very special under this word. His views on 
the responsibilities and marriage partners in it are quite relevant and 
based on mutual loyalty. He is looking for a partner who would be able to 
stimulate him intellectually.

The partner must be a real friend, and not be afraid of his independence and 
not be afraid to seem an individualist. At the same time, such a person is a 
dominant and strong person, and when he gets what he wants, he tries to 
change his partner, while he can find someone who could really dominate. 
This all creates the preconditions for falls and ups in the marriage. If you 
can find a partner that meets the ultra-high "lion’s" requirements, then he 
will become the best friend and the most important person.""",

"Pisces": """ The seventh house in Pisces means that the partner opens up 
new areas of interest to these people, helps them to perceive others more 
widely and reveals the wealth of the world of sensations. Such people 
attract the others to themselves hypnotically, and they themselves strive 
for the natures deep and mysterious. They are striving in business 
cooperation and marital relations to discover something important and 
profound, as well as realize a deep inclination towards guardianship and 
patronage. They very accurately and subtly feel any situation, however, they 
do not always react tactfully to it.

A major role in the selection of companions is personal antipathy and 
sympathy. They, in the performance of contractual relations, as usual, are 
demanding of the others, but not to themselves. In general, they tend to 
avoid direct responsibility. Any pressure on themselves they endure very 
hard and painful.

Open enemies in a person with a 7th house in Pisces may not be, at least, 
they do not strike the eye, but many often fail and deceive, without 
producing significant attacking actions. Struggle occurs on the principle of 
"a knife in the back" — there is no question of any "open visor". The 
enemies are unobtrusive, soft, slippery and the nature of the connections 
with them is constantly changing, so they are not easy to track and notice.

As a partner, this person is at first pretty attractive, soft, soft and 
gentle. He does not contradict colleagues as much as he adapts to them. 
Unfortunately, later it turns out that the argument goes against his 
behavior. For example, not having fulfilled his obligations, he openly 
convinces his partner that he did not give them to them.

The activity of the group is perceived by this person in a distorted form 
and is vague and vague. In partnership, there are a lot of emotions, 
illusions, false pity, manipulation and mysterious misunderstandings. Only 
diligent work on yourself will lead to reliable love, mutual assistance, and 
also deep sensitive interactions.

Such a person is looking for an idealistic and impractical partner who will 
offer him sympathy and support. A marriage with an invalid or alcoholic is 
possible, which will give him a sad shade. At the same time, it is possible 
to find a real knight on a horse — and someone else will not be able to come 
up. Because of his predisposition to criticism, as well as "searching for a 
needle in a haystack," he will face countless difficulties when it comes to 
dealing with other people. Balanced, good judgment will help him get rid of 
certain credulity, mainly when it comes to other people."""

far he can go in debt obligations.

This person is often threatened by acute illnesses and accidents that can 
radically change his life, if there is no clear circumspection. In public 
relations, two extremes are revealed, either an absolute opposition to 
oneself to the collective, or a fanatical adherence to the group’s settings. 
Such a person can masterfully influence the relationship of the group. In 
every crisis, he must act boldly and decisively. In connection with the 
legacy, there can be unpleasant and long legal disputes. Multiple 
disagreements are possible, given joint debt obligations and finance.

A person with 8th house in Aries regains lost positions and regains lost 
strength, thanks to courageous, brave and courageous actions. He should 
learn with any changes in life, quickly and efficiently develop new plans 
and of course be able to bring the rest started — to the end. With all sorts 
of changes, hesitation and inaction are dangerous. The death of such a 
person is usually sudden and fast.

Such a person divorces, marries and gets a job as a paratrooper. However, 
then he has to disassemble so vigorously and promptly boiled porridge for a 
long time. An inner fear of big changes and stress conditions is possible. 
Wherever it is necessary to be energetic and active, such a person sometimes 
falls into indifference and resorts to the policy of the "ostrich".

At superhigh development, he is keen to correct and accurate behavior in 
extreme moments. This person is inclined to transient, sharp, vigorous 
psychological fractures, over which he is almost imperious. The ethics of 
the group are very zealous. His attacks of protest, the group, as a rule, 
severely suppresses. At superhigh development the probability of vigorous 
influence on the moral code and the ideology of the team develops.

Excessive sexual activity of such a person is revealed in creativity. A 
sense of inferiority and insecurity can be expressed, which is quickly 
replaced by impudence and insolence. Deep psychological need for inner 
silence and security can be gratified only by the awareness of the need to 
help the rest — instead of constantly thinking about oneself. If, however, 
his partner is quite sensitive, it will help him to determine himself.

Sometimes there is a pronounced attention to the occult — the knowledge of 
esotericism excites the interest of this person and makes him profound and 
stable. A person is keenly interested in the question of death, but not 
because of horror, but because of the readiness to explore this

transformations become lengthy, which greatly exhausts the neighbors and 
himself. On a loan of funds, this person goes deliberately, always striving 
— to clearly imagine what he will have to pay for the loan. Psychological 
fractures are difficult, because he is inclined to focus on certain 
circumstances and conditional visions, regarded by him as unbeatable 
difficulties.

In a collective relationship, a person with an 8th house in Taurus comes

consistently and firmly defend the interests of the community. He should 
learn to compromise and the flexibility of behavior between group moral 
values and his own ethics. The death of such people usually turns out to be 
calm.

Any changes such people consider as hard work — divorce, marriage, 
employment, change of residence and dismissal. All changes are seen as 
protracted and difficult, they remain in the memory of emotions even when 
happening at a leisurely and at the required time. Any reorganization seems 
to such a person to be unrealizable and hopelessly complex. In extreme 
moments, it takes a pretty heavy and long effort. Usually, they are revealed 
to him by force, although it does not become easier for all of this.

He should learn to overcome his own stubbornness, stagnation and not look 
for from strained situations of straightforward ways out. Psychological 
crises are difficult and long, without much faith in the victory and 
themselves. The main condition for winning a change for this person is to 
believe that all of them are in principle permissible. Interests of the 
group, this person defends adamantly and consistently. In general, he

study of occult manifestations. Often such people have the ability for

prolonged crisis and his transition to a chronic situation. In general, in 
itself to understand this person is much more difficult than it may seem in 
the beginning. Major mental difficulties in his case, consist of many small 
dead ends and small hooks kaleidoscopically replacing each other.

He remarkably expresses in words the opinion of society, on questions of 
group ideology and ethics. His attitude to the needs of the team is purely 
rational and without unnecessary emotions. It is subject to change, in the 
course of a certain group work. To the secret reality, this man shows a 
purely mental interest — in the beginning he seeks to learn more about 
everything, and then proceeds to mental manipulation with the psyche of 
those around him.

life. He will not abate until that time, until he reaches the highest level 
of understanding. To all pathological inclinations, is cautious and wise. 
Very interested in the occult. Often shows an interest in the mental, but

In all cases, interconnected with corporate money, he successfully invests 
in finance in development. And he makes a profit, at the expense of money, 
that they invested for the sake of the general welfare. Extreme situations

ability to defend themselves and cope with experiences and emotions coming 
from the bottom of the subconscious. Passing through another change, such a

adjust to new conditions.

Probably fear of any significant changes and a very negative attitude

deeply, although he is not inclined to tell about them. They are connected 
not so much with purely psychological as with spiritual problems, so only 
together with the resolution of the latter, it is possible to defeat the 
crisis itself.

Bad stereotypes and instincts are very strong and tenacious, and therefore 
from them to be released and not pleasant, and not easy. All the cares of 
the collective, this subject perceives quite personally and extremely 
zealously, striving to become for everyone, not a carer and patron, or 
parasitic on group energy. However, in a difficult time for a group, a

idea of explicit power, which a person can not get neither over people 
around him, nor over circumstances, nor over himself. It is necessary to 
humble thirst for ostentatious power and gain endurance — only then, 
overcoming crises will be pleasant and simple. In transitional situations, 
these people tend to follow ultra-high standards and pure standards, behave 
with dignity and noble ways. There is a desire to subordinate ethics and 
collective will to oneself.

At superhigh development, the ideologue-publicist ripens fervently 
condemning social defects and announcing unusual norms and ideals. This man 
welcomes witchcraft, energetically-strong-willed. He himself has a 
tremendous power of suggestion, as well as the ability to effectively 
suggest. This is an adventurer who despises death and loves risk. Excessive 
pleasure in bodily pleasures, can significantly reduce its vitality. Sex is 
for him a means of self-expression, and therefore, he prefers diversity in 
this area of life.

When dealing with a partner, he insists on full mutual return. He tries to 
fully control the property of his partner, but he is rather generous and 
gladly shares time and money. It is necessary to beware of exhaustion and 
not to overwork the heart. Often these people are attracted to the career of 
bankers, success in which is quite likely, because there is considerable 
support for society. """,

"Virgo": """ The eighth house in Virgo means — because of the sensation of 
doubtful foundations, this subject needs reliable support. Without it, even 
small alterations can not be overcome. This is not a vigilant and 
absent-minded person, showing a strange inattention in connection with 
financial obligations, which leads to a loss of confidence from partners and 
colleagues. At the same time, in solving fundamental, strategic tasks, such 
a person can show amazing pettiness. Because of this, it risks losing 
assistance, really standing partners.

Often, the income of a person with 8th house in Virgo provides completely at 
the expense of business partners. Not the existence of a satisfying answer 
to the themes of death and life, makes this person needy in safety. With him 
often there are various accidents and troubles, because he irresponsibly 
treats with all sorts of circumstances and all the time gets in trouble. 
Partners help him and business, and ideas, sympathizing with his corporate 
weakness.

Cardinal changes in life, call such a person to a lot of concrete efforts 
and deeds, which he strives to fulfill with all his might, losing sight of 
the true meaning of what is happening. With catastrophic losses, this can 
serve him well. Often, such people lose sight of the meaning of the changes 
that are under way, and subsequently face personal irritation (in connection 
with the change in personal life that has taken place).

Mental crises are accompanied by a cycle on certain details, events and 
facts that he absolutely can not adapt to his consciousness and to which he 
continually returns in his negative meditations. Group ethics are perceived 
by him too specifically, dogmatically and mundane. He can become a wonderful 
financier or politician, a successful manager or minister, but never — a 
priest or an ideologist.

The occult interests of this man are very mundane and concrete. Real he 
considers only those phenomena that can be felt personally. Often, such 
people comprehend the art of healing massage and are interested in practical 
astrology. A person is quite practical, if we talk about managing someone 
else’s finances, and therefore can become a successful bookkeeper or banker. 
It is difficult to provoke interest in parapsychology and esotericism in it, 
since before you believe in something, it will require proof.

Sexual difficulties arise from the fact that he is too critical and 
analytical about his partners, as well as his sexual way of acting, makes 
too great demands. Probably, the latent desire for changes in the love life 
and while life is complicated by the fear associated with the need to 
discover their super-deep sexual desires. The result of all this, can become 
innumerable sexual adventures, which are still coveted satisfaction will not 
deliver.""",

"Libra": """ The eighth house in Libra means partners help these people 
accumulate a huge fortune, and they value this cooperation, doing everything 
to fix it. For them, partnership is the best way to earn money. Often they 
benefit from various kinds of insurance and wills. When solving issues of 
personal solvency, these people manage not to cross the line, so they rarely 
get into debt. They value their ability to discover new sources of profit, 
which are most often found in opportunities for more active and broader 
cooperation. They look at death more than calmly.

The person with the 8th house in Libra treats every serious change in his 
life objectively and reasonably, coordinating his position with the opinion 
of the public. He seeks to consider changes in general and it is advisable 
for them, to change their mental perception of the world, which in reality 
is not sufficiently revealed by simple occupation. Psychological stress in 
the life of a given person, usually associated with the loss of the place of 
equilibrium, on which its internal scales are based. At times, human 
relations with the public’s subconscious are exposed to catastrophic 
influences, or they become weaker, or become too frank and visible.

He seeks to solve the arising problems objectively-mentally, trying to 
please everyone — new and old, social and personal, selfish inclinations and 
higher aspirations. Such a person should learn frankness with his person, he 
must avoid transactions with his conscience. Relations with the group are 
good, because he is perfectly aware of the social ethics, which in many ways 
determines his personal position. In significant tasks, he will be able to 
find a consistent and reasonable response, to which members of society tend 
to listen.

The location to the occult, rather general-aesthetic. Especially appreciated 
is the synthetism of the occult world picture. Such a person prefers 
sorcery, where the Subtle World is subdued by the thought and will of the 
sorcerer. But not mysticism, where the Subtle World is full of different 
beings and animated. Such a person is able to make a marriage of convenience 
(for the sake of inheritance or money), in which it is later possible to be 
bitterly disappointed. He is soon overtaken by unhappy love, and having 
learned from her sad experience, with subsequent love, he tries to pay the 
most attention to the person to whom he bestows his favor.

He should avoid excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, because this 
can lead to kidney disease. He manages to reach compromises in resolving 
financial disputes, and mastering this art is a testament to his maturity. 
Often, he tries to act as a judge who deals with organizational and 
financial issues. Success in banking is possible, probably a natural ability 
to resolve other people’s issues.

Sex can occupy a valuable place of life, but often one connection to these 
people is not enough. He strives to apply all the possibilities, which may 
lead to a great variety of addictions, but in addition to a small number of 
really deep and meaningful love relationships.""",

"Scorpio": """ The eighth house in Scorpio means — the life of this person, 
full of conflicts and secrets related to money, issues of change and a group 
of partners, death and inheritance. Operations with borrowed finance are 
almost always controversial. Sources of their loans, such a person keeps 
secret from the rest. In attracting loans, indiscreet and passionate, and 
therefore there is a risk of being enslaved by debt liability.

The life of a man with 8th house in Scorpio is full of problems and crises 
connected with the transfer of money, mutual corporate duties and monetary 
obligations. He refers to the replacement of the main conditions of his 
being, very biased and emotionally, in the depths of his soul, charging them 
with many illusions. He needs to remember that external problems, mostly 
global (suitable husband, pleasant surroundings, adequate work), are solved 
only as the spiritual knots are unraveled. Without this, any changes in 
external conditions lead only to an increase in the burden on the psyche.

With low development in extreme moments, such a person tends to fall into 
hysterics, freeing himself from any responsibility, emitting extreme 
irritation and anger and adjusting duties and guilt to others. When working 
on yourself, develops reliability, a sense of responsibility for others and 
for yourself the ability to overcome extreme circumstances without jerking 
and wailing. However, this is not easy, because the tensions are constantly 
high. Psychological crises are ordinary and deep, although they are not 
always visible to surrounding people. They are very emotionally worried, as 
a result, a person can completely change, although it is impossible to 
predict in advance how. The passage of crises is complicated by the bias of 
self-analysis and excessive emotional evaluation of oneself.

In the team, these people are respected, mainly in the discussion of ethical 
issues. They are able to express the truth, which the others can not or fear 
to express. Such a person is usually intensely interested in reincarnation 
and mysticism, has a hypnotic gift, and is also inclined to practice 
occultism. However, these witchcraft lessons for such a person are risky, 
since he simply becomes a puppet of bad influences. Such a person loves 
life, but to all problems associated with death, he treats as demanding 
understanding and necessary. The inferiority complex is probable, and for 
the sake of self-affirmation this person will expose himself to all sorts of 
dangers.

This person can assert himself through sex in the most problematic and 
unexpected forms. He knows how to get along with big finances, knows their 
value and is able to achieve triumph in financial affairs, managing monetary 
accounting and of course planning operations with money. Sometimes such 
people are excessively addicted to death, especially if they can not find a 
reasonable use of their creative energy. Usually, they stand confidently on 
the ground, and also avoid incomprehensible or inaccessible things.""",

"Sagittarius": """ The eighth house in Sagittarius means that such a person 
easily achieves success by attracting borrowed funds, as well as placing 
finance in circulation. He has a wonderful instinct for disguised financial 
opportunities, intuitively anticipating the time that is favorable for 
concluding insurance contracts and executing wills. Often, he benefits 
greatly from engaging in insurance, notarial or banking matters. Often these 
people receive a huge inheritance without any complications. Their financial 
partners are friendly and reliable, due to this the growth of their 
well-being, is steady and stable.

During the significant changes in life, this person with the 8th house in 
Sagittarius behaves fervently and famously, not being afraid of anything. 
Although, he is somewhat superficial in assessing phenomena, which later, 
only you can regret. Fate can act with this person quite unceremoniously and 
cruelly, chasing him through changes in cracking and kicking. Extreme 
situations are extremely acute, and he should learn how to get out of them 
without forcing and plastic.

The main thing is not to focus only on one enthusiasm, but add it with logic 
and attention. Psychological crises are quite vigorous and often seem to him 
due to external factors. At the same time, the way to solve problems is one 
- this is an inner transformation and, of course, a transition to higher 
vibrations. This requires hot and fervent claims to the whole world to be 
transferred to oneself.

In relations with society, two extremes are likely, or he is completely 
identified with the collective and turns out to be a fanatic, losing his 
personal ethics and individuality of his opinion, or he contrasts his 
position collectively loudly and firmly, usually losing in a direct 
collision with the rest.

Occult attention is associated with the energy flows that such a person 
seeks to manage with the help of tense will and developed imagination. 
Concentration exercises should be handled very carefully. The situation is 
remarkable for scientific and research work. He is a refined and inventive 
person, resolutely interested in the philosophy of religion, life after 
death and the meaning of existence.

Relations with a partner can bring him great benefits. There is also the 
possibility of obtaining good property. Despite the huge interest in sex, 
there is a tendency to focus more on the mental than on its physical side. 
In the life of this subject, there is constant assistance from others. He 
can achieve considerable success in the political arena.""",

"Capricorn": """ The eighth house in Capricorn means that such a person is 
distinguished by severity in defending his ability to receive a share of 
inheritance or common property. He tries to insure everything that can only 
be insured, and thereby reliably providing himself with compensation. If he 
does not get a suitable share of the property, he will be very worried. When 
obtaining property, legal disputes and delays in legal transactions are 
possible.

Changes in the life of a person with the 8th house in Capricorn go hard and 
long. The problem of dismissal or marriage can drag on for years, requiring 
him to understand something that is clearly not given to him, or a 
combination of purpose and flexibility that can not be achieved. As a 
result, he chooses to just wait. However, he does not need to be lazy or 
hasty in crises. He must carefully and carefully comprehend the signs of 
fate and work hard, creating all the necessary conditions by personal labor. 
Deep fears and complexes associated with the feeling of the "I" at the 
bottom of the deepest well are possible, from there it can never get out.

Psychological crises of this man are traditionally delayed and are often 
associated with bad contacts with the group. However, the main purpose of 
these fractures is to stimulate religious development, specific symptoms and 
problems need to be perceived as signs that determine the nature of the 
spiritual impasse. During prolonged depressions, it is likely that the 
individual is deeply depressed, resulting in a loss of vitality.

Relations with the team are not simple. At first, a person enters public 
life for a long time, but afterwards considers group ethics as the basis of 
personal ethics. He serves the interests of the group for a long time, 
faithfully and faithfully. To the occultism is wary, purposeful and 
materially pragmatic. But if this person becomes a magician, he can achieve 
great practical triumphs. This situation promises a long life and peacefully 
coming death. However, this person is not easy to reconcile with old age, 
and he is afraid of death.

It is quite cautious when it comes to managing common cash. There are great 
difficulties associated with the management of his partner’s property. Has a 
natural gift for saving, so he successfully disposes of other people’s 
money. Often such people are identified by successful accountants or bankers 
in large firms. The main problem of their life is the ordering of the system 
of material and spiritual values. In collisions with foes and troubles, this 
person shows exceptional courage and rare courage.""",

"Aquarius": """ The eighth house in Aquarius means that such a person is 
actively involved in the spiritual aspects of life. Probably the presence of 
mediumistic talents and paranormal mental susceptibility to the moods and 
thoughts of others. Often these people are involved in financial programs of 
large-scale events in society. They are often chosen as trustees for 
corporate property and inheritance.

The problem of death overtakes this person, with the loss of their close 
friends. The deaths of comrades, it is enough to deeply touch him, although 
he does not show it from the outside. All the changes are unpredictable and 
unusual in his life. The future throws him his ideas of reinforcing 
excessive loads and patterns of behavior in extreme situations. Extreme 
situations of this kind that do not settle into everyday life and require 
from the person of an inventive way of thinking and an unconventional 
approach.

At the 8th house in Aquarius, psychological decline, as well as external 
changes, are possible in two types: long and sharp. Sharp decline is due to 
the difficulty of getting used to the picture of the world of an unexpected 
idea, which for a while can divide the subconscious and force a person to 
live simultaneously in two realities — an extravagant new and habitual old 
one. If a critical crisis does not win, then it goes into a chronic crisis, 
when a person is not satisfied with himself, and for self-renewal lacks 
strength and real desire, because fear is strong before the new and unusual.

To group ethics, this subject is neutral. It is inclined to respect group 
interests and to make friends with everyone, although, to the questions of 
morality and ideology of the group, it is put without special enthusiasm, 
rationally and coolly. In the occultism of this man, the extravagance and 
complexity of the picture of the world is attracted, and of course sorcery 
with its capabilities of mental control of reality. Despite some rapid 
achievements, regular success calls him to much work. Sex is seen as a game, 
all stages of love are explored in an unconventional and restrained manner. 
Indecision in itself can come to light more than curiosity, and then sexual 
intimacy is tempered by coquetry and talk.

Such a person has an original intuition and expressed unusual abilities. He 
should not act on prepared schemes, dangerous manifestations of credulity. 
It attracts all esoteric, he loves to do what is called other 
non-traditional. Often falls into depression. There are significant 
difficulties in managing third-party money and general reserves. First you 
need to learn how to bring your finances to order. There is a tendency to 
free judgments, as well as courageous assessments when discussing the issues 
of death.""",

"Pisces": """ The eighth house in Pisces means — such a person is constantly 
predisposed to the dangers associated with membership in corporate business 
(corporate) and borrowed funds. Uncontrolled growth of debts, it is 
possible, it will put on the verge of bankruptcy. Serious difficulties with 
inheritance and division of group ownership are possible.

Understanding the mortality of all living things is very painful. Such 
subjects do not like to think about the end of life, they hold on to life 
with all their might and in any way try to prolong it. There is a marked 
disposition towards drug addiction. To the delivery of the inheritance, this 
person does not take very seriously, because he feels the fundamental 
inessentiality of this problem for life.

The huge changes in the lives of people with the 8th house in Pisces are 
occurring nontotentially and as if by themselves. They occur, flow and are 
carried out unexpectedly, without fractures and accents. It is very 
important to give good attention to detail, not just resting on your 
intuition, otherwise you may be deceived as individuals or destiny. Extreme 
situations are relaxed, and even powerful overloads are given simply.

With the disharmonious development of temperament, several attempts will be 
required to make changes, and the share of questions remains unresolved. It 
is very important to realize that significant external changes only reflect 
the corresponding emotional changes. Psychological crises are difficult to 
determine, because even the person does not really understand what is 
happening to him. Elementary, he does not like the inner and surrounding 
reality, I want something incomprehensible and unclear. Internal changes are 
often interrelated with severe depressions, mediumship and hysteria. Getting 
rid of such annoyance requires a person of considerable inner honesty and 
great dedication.

Relations with the society are diverse and diverse, but never the collective 
can not completely conquer this subject — it invariably finds an outlet in 
the ethical group code and shifts the responsibility entirely to the rest. 
Such people intuitively perceive the values of the ethics of the group and 
manage to subordinate their personal principles to them, which makes them 
the favorites of many, and of course uncritical and natural conductors of 
the collective will.

This person should learn to be natural and at the same time respect the 
attitudes of the public, and for this, first and foremost one must try to 
understand both the group and oneself. He is quite sensitive, and when he 
sympathizes with someone, he is able to direct the power of personal 
intuition positive. He needs to learn how to act with others and help the 
needy. As a result, he realizes that on personal errors you can soon learn 
everything. When it comes to the property of a partner, the case can end 
with mutual accusations and deceit.

Very sensitive to consideration of their sexual abilities. This person needs 
to be cautious enough when it comes to the use of narcotic drugs and 
anesthetics, one should never be too lazy to consult a doctor about this, 
especially before a surgical operation. Sex may or may not be of particular 
importance for such a person, or he considers it an important addition to 
what seems to him to be paramount in a joint life when it comes to 
meaningful and profound emotional relationships."""

house9 = { "Aries": """ People who are born when the 9th house in Aries, 
after growing up, become adamant idealists. They have the ability to 
contemplate eternity on an intuitive level, without exerting almost any 
effort. They perceive what is happening in reality, as something that arises 
from the boundless.

This feature allows them to be literally prophets of their own destiny, 
because of what they are very lucky, and they often find inspiration. These 
people, as a rule, prefer dramatic creativity to everything else. Moreover, 
they themselves have the capacity for it, so most playwrights were born 
exactly when there was a 9 House in Aries.

Such people are extremely sensitive to worldview and philosophical pressure. 
They are uncomfortable when someone tries to impose their opinion on the 
world order. Moreover, they do not like to participate in various rituals 
and are extremely reluctant to follow dogmas that do not have a clear 
explanation. In view of their perseverance, they build an excellent defense 
against the opponents’ arguments, and with all their might try to defend 
their point of view, proving that it is the most faithful.

Surrounding people are sometimes dumbfounded by how a person born at a 
specified moment, neglects the values accepted in society. For example, an 
individual born when the House is in Aries may be skeptical of the need for 
higher education. However, the point here is that such a person gets 
inspiration from other things — from his own ardent and energetic "I".

These people are brave and strong. They rarely make ambiguous statements, 
like concreteness and are always determined in their actions. It’s easy for 
them to get together, and that’s why they decide all the time on time. Such 
a person does not tolerate situations when someone shows cowardice and 
weakness. They measure everything by themselves, and when an individual does 
not correspond to their ideas, they try to avoid it. They also do not like 
lies and laziness.

They always follow their ideal. He indicates to such people the goals to be 
achieved. At the same time for a man born, when the 9th House in Aries these 
goals are fully understood, and therefore means to achieve them is not 
difficult to find. In this case, the ideals of such people may be different. 
They are extremely subjective and depend on the subtle features of a 
person’s character and experience.

Such an individual seeks to find a spiritual mentor, a teacher who can tell 
about things that can form a clear opinion about the world around him. 
However, as it was already possible to understand from the above, the choice 
of a mentor such a person is taken very seriously. He needs a spiritually 
enlightened teacher whose ideas and opinions do not contradict constructs 
that already exist in the mind of a person.

In view of the fact that such an individual is well-developed intuition, and 
he perceives information faster than many others, he can form an opinion 
about his divine origin. This has a very positive effect on his activities — 
gives strength and confidence. Thanks to this, he can create really new 
things that will be of interest to society.

Born when the Ninth House is in Aries, they love to travel, discover new 
horizons. In this case, such a man likes to judge more than to act as a 
defender. The individual has a rather strange for many views on what is 
happening. This is because he does not accept dogma, but seeks a new one, 
his own way.""",

"Taurus": """ People who are born when the 9th house in Taurus are very 
sensitive to values that look practical and are seen as beautiful and clean. 
Such a person, forming an opinion about the world around, draws attention 
exclusively to his past experience. Because of this, it is difficult to 
persuade him or to impose his point of view on a situation, especially if 
the argument is based on theoretical arguments.

They differ in fairness, they believe that all people should be equal and 
have equal riches. These people do not oppose the system of generally 
accepted values. They soberly evaluate them, and are well aware that many of 
the accepted dogmas do allow one to maintain peace in society.

They have a clear idea of their "I", and therefore the impact on it from the 
outside almost does not affect. People born when 9 House in Taurus, 
extremely appreciate weight, seriousness, calmness and confidence. At the 
same time, they are categorically negative about the superficiality and the 
reasonableness. Also, such individuals do not greatly revere sentimentality.

Their ideal has a strong effect on their behavior and life in general. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that these people can have an internal 
conflict. In this regard, from time to time, such a person has to compromise 
with himself, and sometimes completely change his point of view in order to 
achieve goals.

The development of such people is smooth. Their perceptions and opinions are 
constantly transformed under the influence of the external environment. In 
the event that a person closes from the surrounding reality, his ideal is 
replaced by primitive constructions that are completely inappropriate for 
the real world.

However, if the formation of an ideal for such a person has gone along a 
problem path, the situation can still be corrected. But we must remember 
that the restructuring of the picture of the world and its own "I" is 
difficult. To the individual this can bring great suffering, and therefore 
not everyone achieves this goal.

In order for a person to change his point of view, no matter how primitive 
and unacceptable it is, he needs to demonstrate solid evidence. He must 
personally verify that he was wrong. In addition, there must be a powerful 
incentive for it to begin to transform. However, when the reformation of 
one’s own "I" ends, the person is completely transformed. He will never 
return to his past life, as he realizes everything he did wrong and how good 
the new way is.

People whose Ninth House in Taurus are quite serious about the mentors. At 
first they show skepticism, and therefore subject the teacher to checks. The 
reason for this lies in the fact that interaction with the bearers of 
ideals, they perceive, as something extremely important. However, when they 
are convinced of the honesty and justice of the ideas of another person, 
they are doing their utmost to absorb them. Such people are very hardworking 
and responsible. However, they learn slowly. The point here is not in the 
bad perception of new information, but in the fact that they are very 
meticulous. Sometimes it comes to tediousness.

Such an individual is skeptical about philosophical ideas. He can start to 
perceive them only if he is convinced that under them there is a real, 
unshakable foundation. A mystical experience such a person receives only 
through interaction with reality. He can come to him in the form of certain 
circumstances or events.

The behavior of such people is directed solely at getting benefits. They are 
critical of what is happening, they can analyze and draw conclusions for a 
long time. However, people born when the Ninth House in Taurus, always 
looking for evidence. Otherwise, they do not draw conclusions about 
anything. They prefer to keep the question open, than hastily solve it.

Ideally, such a person has firm principles. Even if they contradict 
conscience, they will prefer not to hear their inner voice. Such people get 
inspiration from physical work. Their ideas and sense perception are very 
stable, but they lack a mystical worldview. They unconsciously seek the 
material.""",

"Gemini": """ People born when the 9 house in Gemini are guided by logic in 
the process of choosing own path. They have a healthy pragmatism in all

the process, trying to choose the most successful.

They like to talk and write on philosophical and religious topics. They can 
also be good opponents in disputes that concern some social issues. Such 
people aspire to knowledge, they want to be and seem smart, intellectually 
savvy, strong spirit, communicative, interesting and attractive. Therefore, 
they constantly look for ways to help others and demonstrate their own 
skills.

If a person was born when the 9th house is in Gemini, then in adulthood he 
takes a superficial attitude to his ideal "I". His ideal self-image is 
rather unstable. From time to time certain traits are lost in it, replaced 
by others (sometimes completely opposite).

When interacting with one’s own self, one can be subject to self-deception. 
Therefore, it is extremely important for such an individual to find his 
spiritual core, on which he could rely. Otherwise, the "I" will wander, and 
a person will never reveal his full potential.

Such people like to argue, and they are good at participating in them. They 
are well-educated and have excellent methods of rhetoric and demagogy. 
Thanks to this, almost always come out winners from an honest discussion. 
Although, perhaps, instead, it would be better for them to show the power of 
thought. Because, resorting to demagoguery, such a person convinces in some 
idea not only his opponents, but also himself.

The individual forms his own ideal, focusing on the current state of 
affairs. His "I" should be applicable to solving pressing problems and 
achieving the set goals. Such people often reflect and talk about high 
ideas, however, they rarely get to the things with which they could make 
them come true.

Born in the period when 9 House in Gemini, constantly expand consciousness. 
In their psyche are constantly observed some changes. However, they are 
superficial. These people try to focus on the comprehension of spiritual 
truths, while in the study of some practical knowledge they show enthusiasm, 
often even more than necessary. Such an individual wants to visit distant 
countries. However, when it turns out in them, it is difficult for him to 
digest everything that he perceived.

These people have a good potential for learning foreign languages, they like 
logical philosophical ideas and theoretical knowledge. Mystical experience 
such people are able to perceive when he comes to them consistently and 
logically explained. The individual is constantly in search of truth. He is 
very interested in the riddles of being, the disclosure of which he would 
like to comprehend on his own experience.

In this everyday life, such a person may be a victim of gossip. Often he has 
conflicts with his family. At the same time, he later logically explains 
everything, but still can not defend himself against the new "attack". 
Therefore, he often has to stay away from the close relationship.""",

"Cancer": """ A man born when the 9th house in Cancer is extremely emotional 
and adamant in matters of religion and philosophical teachings. It is 
difficult for him to change the ideas about the high that have formed over 
the years as a result of sensory experience and acceptance of ideas. This 
does not happen, even if there is a powerful social impact.

The world view of such people tends more toward traditional values, to 
family values. They may not have a higher education, however, they always 
impose the need for it to receive their own children. It is believed that 
only this can be considered an indicator of high literacy and harmonious 
development of the individual.

They take religion very seriously. At the same time, the most important is 
the connection with those who share the same vision of the world. Such 
people treat their colleagues as a second family. A person born when 9 House

from the usual place, although the desire to go somewhere still remains. 
Therefore, in his spare time, he can dream about distant countries, watch 
adventure films or read books.

These people want to be good family men and loyal friends. Therefore, they 
are very kind, gentle, capable of sincere love and care. Sometimes they want 
to be mysterious and mysterious. At the same time, they can resort to 
manipulative techniques.

For such a person’s own ideal "I" is a rather intimate thing. When some 
disagreement occurs with him, there is a strong discomfort, which certainly 
leads to significant emotional experiences, and sometimes even — suffering. 
In view of intimacy, such a person will not discuss his ideal "I" with other 
people. For him, this topic is completely taboo, and he admits to her only 
himself and then with great care.

Such a person develops through the expansion of the boundaries of his inner 
glasnost. This happens every time an individual interacts with the ideal 
"I", discusses with him the level of demand for himself. Such people are 
infinitely difficult to change. Even if they have a strong desire to do 
this, at the first difficulties they are overwhelmed by emotions, fear 
arises, and they take a step back. However, if the individual still manages 
to overcome himself, he certainly expects many discoveries, both in the 
external world, and in himself, his own subconscious.

To the teachers such a person is relatively calm. With them, home 
relationships are established, almost like with a family member. However, 
they are again very intimate. The reason for this lies in the peculiarities

matter how good they are in matters of upbringing, the individual will take

ability to influence people. This is due to well-developed intuition and 
eloquence. Thanks to this, he can become an excellent teacher, trainer,

"Leo": """ It may seem that people born in the period when the 9th house in

Subconsciously, they are striving for growth, ascent to the main stage in 
their sphere (whether public, political or professional). Virtually all the 
energy they spend on the study of philosophical teachings or religious 
trends. At the same time, when they achieve certain results, they can begin

all who have only recently joined the religious life. These people want to 
have patronage over someone. They tend to show themselves strong, confident, 
beautiful, noble, honest, and most importantly imperious. In this case, 
popularity and fame is one of the most important criteria necessary to 
obtain the desired.

The ideal "I" of such a person is strong and very energetic. For this 
reason, it strongly presses on the individual, sometimes literally forcing 
him to perform certain actions. Development, at the same time, occurs 
through the smoothing of all acute angles and harmonization. In the process, 
the individual renounces primitive ideas and superfluous 
straightforwardness. But in order to realize, a person needs to make a lot 
of efforts, and focus on the formation of a more clear-cut thinking, as well 
as awareness of the completeness of the picture of the world.

During the formation of the ideal "I" a person has to analyze past 
experience, find ways to reconcile with certain circumstances and learn 
modesty. The consciousness of such an individual is expanding very rapidly. 
As a result, from time to time in his psyche there is a turning point, which 
can completely change the worldview. When this happens, he has to make 
considerable efforts to adapt to unusual conditions, which can be quite 
difficult to do.

Such a person is very suspicious of teachers and spiritual mentors. The 
reason for this lies in the unconscious fear of authority. However, the 
individual hardly recognizes this. However, if the mentor can find the trust 
of such a person, then the training will go quite smoothly.

A man born when the ninth house is in Leo is an optimist. He likes to 
travel. Such an individual continually strives to develop his mind. He is 
confident, energetic, and therefore always counts only on victory, and 
another result he can not arrange.""",

always confirmed by some facts. When there are some new ideas, he does not 
take them thoughtlessly. In the beginning, they are subjected to thorough 
analysis. Only if, as a result of this, there were no discrepancies, they

Thanks to the fact that such a person likes to analyze and study everything, 
he can find his application in jurisprudence, and if a religious path has 
been chosen, then he will become a theologian. The acquisition of higher 
education, as well as the study of various doctrines, is given to such an 
individual rather hard. However, he considers it his duty to finish the 
business and reach the end. Such people have great respect for themselves. 
In particular, they are proud of the fact that all their ideas find a useful 
application in the real world.

A man born at a time when the Ninth House was in Virgo is very purposeful, 
wants to always be necessary and useful to society. He may have a desire to 
build his own house, in which he will feel most comfortable.

The ideal "I" of such people is formed from small things. Therefore, its 
formation takes quite a long time. A person collects facts, ideas, theories 
in order to find the only thing that will become the main feature of his 
ideal character. Despite the desire and a certain desire, to achieve this he 
will never succeed. The problem is that he is very picky. Even if something 
seems to him suitable at first, then he reveals a lot of flaws in it and 
sweeps it away. This, by the way, is perceived residual painfully.

The expansion of consciousness is very tight. The individual lacks the 
imagination and breadth of views to reconstruct the picture of perception. 
As a result, at a certain moment, a psychological crisis, depression may 
occur. Instead of building your consciousness anew, a person looks at the 
fragments of his past the ideal "I" and can not accept loss.

When such people manage to find a spiritual mentor, they show a penchant for 
literalism, a literal perception of doctrines. They try to make out all the 
cogs, and understand how everything works. However, they overlook the main 
thing — God is not a machine. It must be perceived in a completely different 
way. When such a person falls into an unfamiliar culture, he does not know 
where to look. The focus is endlessly wandering, as a result of which 
everything is perceived extremely superficially.

Mystical experiences of such a person can arise as a result of performing 
various work tasks. Most often he can imagine that his work is similar to 
clearing the "Augean stables," and he is a Hercules who does unbearable 
work.

Such people can spend a lot of time on business trips. In the process, they 
expand the horizon, which is very useful for the individual. They are 
friendly enough towards other people, are sympathetic and are always ready 
to offer their services as an intermediary.""",

"Libra": """ The person born when the 9th house in Libra has a world view 
that is based on the principles of beauty and harmony. Such people like to 
visit new places. However, in order for them to go on a trip, they need 
guarantees that they will pass in a pleasant society and comfortable 
surroundings. Therefore, they often take with them on a journey people they 
trust: relatives, friends or colleagues. When they become acquainted with 
the peculiarities of the culture of other peoples, almost all attention is 
focused exclusively on aesthetics and products of art.

A person born at a time when the 9th house in Libra, prefer to work with 
cultured and educated people. Quite often such an individual seeks a 
companion in another country. At the same time, it is necessary that the 
spouse or wife should have a good education and upbringing. The character of 
such a person includes such qualities as elegance, refinement, elitism, 
tact, politeness, objectivity, developed intellectual abilities. He is proud 
of them, and also very much appreciates them in other people.

The ideal "I" of such a person is formed as a result of the impact of the 
social group in which he is. In this case, the indications that the 
individual gives his ideal are not always clear. Therefore, sometimes you 
have to make efforts to decipher them. As a rule, the "I" tells a person 
that his behavior at a certain point ceases to be satisfactory. It also 
gives advice on how to act to improve.

The expansion of consciousness in such people occurs as a result of mental 
perception. However, it happens rather tightly. At the same time, it will be 
difficult to break old ones, they were formed under the influence of society 
and authorities. If a person decides to change his thinking, then he must 
find new criteria for the perception of the beautiful.

As for the relationship with the spiritual mentor, the teacher is perceived 
as something abstract, from the point of view of public opinion. This is 
absolutely unacceptable. The study of various philosophical and religious 
teachings presupposes existential experiences and individual experience. 
Therefore, before engaging in development, the student will have to 
reconsider his attitude towards the mentors.

Such people are a vivid example of liberals. They seek justice in everything 
and strive for peace everywhere. In view of their sophistication, they can 
manifest themselves in art (painting or music). Such an individual begins to 
get irritated when faced with obscenities or awkwardness. Throughout his 
life, a person wants to find a practical and beautiful philosophy, which at 
the same time will be quite accessible. Often it is these people who begin 
to study numerology and / or astrology.""",

"Scorpio": """ The person who came into the world when the 9th house in 
Scorpio becomes very religious in adulthood and deepens deeply into the 
study of philosophy. Is an ardent debater when it comes to matters of faith, 
ethics and worldview. He tries to keep in touch with everything that happens 
in the world. He can actively participate not only in religious and 
philosophical discussions, but also freely discuss politics. Always counting 
on success. For this he uses all means. The reason for the inflexibility 
lies in the fact that it is difficult for such a person to survive failure.

People born when the 9th house in Scorpio tend to be smart, uncompromising, 
determined and strong. They want absolute power over people, for which they 
often resort to psychological manipulation. Most of all, they do not like 
indecisiveness, weakness, dullness and excessive talkativeness. If they meet 
a person and notice these qualities in him, they immediately stop the 
conversation and tear the contact.

Their own ideal "I" in such people contain many mutually exclusive and 
contradictory ideas. Because of this, they can demand from themselves 
actions that are simply impossible to realize. In view of the strong 
pressure of the ideal, such people can absolutely not suit themselves. As a 
result, they develop neurosis, and then depression.

The only way to avoid negative consequences for the psyche is to train and 
develop the ideal "I". However, this will require a lot of work. The most 
important thing is to identify all the discrepancies and resolve 
intrapersonal conflicts.

Such people do not like to look into themselves, because their subconscious 
is unordered. This complicates the process of expanding consciousness. Often 
in order to somehow adjust the attitude of the individual it is necessary to 
resort to the help of an experienced mentor.

With a teacher, such a person can periodically have conflicts. Because of 
this, you have to take breaks in training. However, it is extremely 
necessary to return to it. Otherwise, a person can not quit the 
psychological crisis.

As for travel, such people are attracted to distant exotic countries. They 
are interested in solving mysteries and experiencing a special experience, 
which is possible only when fully immersed in someone else’s culture. Such a 
person often perceives what is happening around through the prism of 
mysticism, occultism. However, this only contributes to its development. He 
is quite lucky, knows how to follow the rules and is noble. Therefore, a 
good doctor, a teacher or a publisher can come out of it.""",

"Sagittarius": """ The person who was born when the 9th house in Sagittarius 
is not able to resist the established social foundations. His philosophy is 
built for the most part on generally accepted moral principles. However, 
such people nevertheless tend to study philosophical works and receive 
higher education.

Society strongly presses on them, so subconsciously they are trying to 
discover new horizons for themselves. They prefer to spend free time on 
research and travel. Also, trying to go beyond the generally accepted 
framework, they try to realize their own individuality.

In the event that a person who was born when the 9th House in Sagittarius is 
once elected to do managerial work, he never again returns to his past 
activities. He likes to manage and give orders. Such people are avid 
travelers. They attract the unknown, they seek to understand the mysteries 
and reveal the riddles. Because of this, they can get into difficult 
situations. However, they manage to easily get out of them. The individual 
wants to be interesting to others. For this he develops strength, mind, 
strives to be noble and brave. However, it negatively relates to people who 
notice tingling, tearfulness or confusion.

Has a very energetic ideal "I". However, it is presented in a somewhat 
abstract form, because of what can not always be manifested in the real 
world. From the subconscious of such a person, interesting thoughts often 
fly out, but as a rule, they do not reach their goals. The problem is that 
ideas change one another, because of what one can not realize one. Such a 
person must learn to be attentive, truly kind and understanding. Otherwise, 
there is a high probability that he will never realize a single worthwhile 
idea.

The expansion of consciousness in these people is easy, but rather 
superficial. When they decide to change, they are filled with enthusiasm, 
and this is what prevents them from understanding and deeply understanding 
all aspects. They communicate freely with spiritual mentors, are ardent, 
inspired and listen attentively. However, because of their inconstancy, they 
can change one guru to another. The results are not very good — they do not 
have time to learn anything.

Such a person can greatly agitate the idea of a round-the-world trip and 
acquaintance with the cultural characteristics of distant countries. 
However, even here they do not go into the topic. Their acquaintance with 
another’s culture is limited to the study of "verses".

However, if a person still finds the strength and develops his full 
potential, then he will make an excellent traveler, translator, 
culturologist or scientist-encyclopaedist. As a result, he will be able to 
form a complete picture of the world. But it should be noted that such

correspond to his own idea of himself. As a result, for a short period, it

In order to avoid such crises, a person must take timely measures and 
balance his own "I". A person should become more emotional, for which it is 
recommended to establish a truly friendly and / or romantic relationship.

The expansion of consciousness is quite easy. Such a person lacks 
imagination, however, if he realizes that a new view of things can bring 
certain benefits, he quickly assimilates. If you get into a foreign country 
or culture, you can not notice interest in such people. However, this is 
only because they hide it well. In fact, they are deeply immersed in the

manipulators. In cases when they appeal to the ideal "I", complete

find the core of the worldview. However, it will not be easy to do this.

Such people expand consciousness by means of changes in the emotional 
spectrum and a change in the emotional response to various stimuli. So, for 
example, you need to think about how to make the factors that used to worry

people. During it, they learn to interact with the other members of the 
group as effectively as possible, which develops diplomatic skills in them.

They are quite dependent on public opinion. But, at the same time, they are 
fairly balanced and calmly consider any issue, trying to solve it most 
correctly. Such a person has an innate ability to harmonize interpersonal 
relationships. Thanks to this, he can easily resolve any conflict, as a 
result of which each participant can get the maximum benefit.

Very carefully approaches to using personal authority in the group to exert 
pressure on her and achieve some of his personal interests. This behavior is 
completely justified, so the thoughtless application of such methods can 
lead to a loss of equilibrium in society. Such people want to look beautiful 
and elegant. This applies not only to appearance, but also to behavior. When 
this happens, they can become arrogant, which leads to quarrels with close 
people.

As for friends, for these people they are of enormous importance. Most often 
they are looking for contacts among musicians, artists, writers and other 
personalities whose activities are directly related to creativity. At the 
same time, they are strongly attached when they find the person they were 
looking for. They completely trust him. In this case, it should be 
remembered that he can not justify the expectations and lead the wrong 
way.""",

"Scorpio": """ The person born when the 11th house in Scorpio is attracted 
to other people by the enterprising and sincere, unselfish desire to come to 
the rescue. However, despite this, he is very suspicious. Before someone 
starts to trust, he needs to check a person many times. However, due to this 
peculiarity, in the end, it forms a really strong environment around itself. 
With weak people communicates rather seldom.

In view of innate enterprise, people who came into being when the 11th House 
in Scorpio often achieve their goals through the use of others. Therefore, 
they perfectly organize the work of the members of the group, define clear 
goals that are important for the majority, and, of course, never forget 
about themselves. Everything that happens inside his social group, is 
perceived extremely emotionally and deeply. He does not like imperfect 
forms, and in case of detection, he makes every effort to correct them.

He does not like to talk, so to speak, about anything. At the same time, 
when it comes to important things that affect the entire social group, it 
can share them with outsiders. As a result, if it does not lead to disaster, 
then at least to quarrels and strife.

Has a great influence on the members of the group. If you have the 
appropriate desire, you can change the views and goals of the team members. 
He does not like when someone from the environment shows intolerance and 
does not follow the sequence in his actions. Such people are very fond of 
criticizing. However, as a rule, they bend the stick.

As a result, their criticism has a destructive effect on the person in 
relation to which it is directed. In order to develop spiritually, such a 
person should learn to find a common language with people, including those 
who are disliked. In addition, he is recommended to lower his level of 
emotionality.

If such a person does not manage to overcome himself, he will often show 
unreasonable behavior. As a result, the team will prop it up against the 
wall, which, for obvious reasons, will not allow him to correct the 
imperfections noticed in society and refine the shortcomings. To remedy the 
situation, he should watch to ensure that his criticism has always been 
objective. Moreover, in the process of its expression it is necessary to 
adhere to generally accepted norms.

Such people like to oppose the group in which they are leaders, to the rest 
of the world. Thanks to this, the collective can give birth to a lot of new, 
innovative ideas. And, if you have the necessary perseverance, realize them 
and get a weighty reward.

When such an individual is in a friendly company, he shows softness and 
kindness. He is quite astute and knows what every member of his company 
wants. However, at the same time, he is quite emotionally vulnerable. He may 
be discouraged by even minor problems that arose with his friends or family 
members.

For really close friends of such people is not enough. However, this is due 
to the fact that he chooses them very long. Thanks to this, he can be 
completely confident in their honesty, fidelity and reliability.""",

Sagittarius, make friends chaotic. They have a lot of friends who have very 
different interests and hobbies. Often among the friends of such individuals 
you can meet representatives of other cultures.

For them, the social status of the person with whom they communicate is 
important. Because of this, they often make contacts with famous and 
influential people, for example, show business stars, politicians, famous 
writers, etc. They are quite optimistic about the world around and look with 
confidence in the future. Thanks to this, it’s easy to start new business, 
sometimes very ambitious.

A man born when the 11 House in Sagittarius, adheres to a broad view and is 
free from virtually any prejudice. The reason for this lies in the fact that 
he communicates with people who hold different, often completely opposite 
opinions about certain situations and objects.

Often, his close acquaintances are representatives of large corporations 
that have great influence. Part of this influence is transferred to him, 
which opens up certain possibilities for him. For a group such people do not 
represent any special functional value. They are, rather, its decoration and 
source of inspiration. Of these, energy is always flowing, which other 
members of the collective are caught.

In a group, it is hard for such a person to work. The reason for this lies 
in the fact that in order to achieve goals in the process of collective 
interaction, it is necessary to exercise restraint, build logical arguments 
and focus on specific things. In the process of work, this person is more 
distracting than helping.

In order to benefit his social group, he needs to learn one thing — do not 
always run up to everyone you see and try to encourage him. Sometimes it’s 
better to leave a person alone, especially if he is busy with something. 
Such people easily accept various ideas. However, their ideology and 
temperament often prevail over the responsibility for the welfare of the 
group. They almost never manage to make any decisions, and their work often 
requires corrections.

If such a person works on his personality and develops, he can become 
someone who raises people around for some sort of thing. Yes, it is 
difficult for them to deal with something specific, but to encourage others 
to make great achievements is easy. Thanks to this they can be good 
psychotherapists, orators or pop stars.

However, when people reach the peak of their development, new friends are 
sure to start hammering to them. This can be a big problem, since from those 
they can often hear flattery and undeserved praise. In view of their 
developed charisma and rapid addiction to people who cause trust, they 
easily make friends and keep warm relations with them all their lives.""",

"Capricorn": """ The person who was born in the period when the 11th house

various adversities. Therefore, in the choice of associates first of all 
draws attention to the availability of the following qualities: reliability 
and conservatism.

Because the reliability of a person is always checked exclusively by time, 
new people close to themselves admit rather slowly. However, when they do 
manage to do this, they get full trust and disposition.

to work in a team, they show great productivity and dedication. Negatively 
relate to those who are many and do not joke about business, shirk from 
performing their duties. They want their social group to work, like a 
well-oiled mechanism. For this reason, they tend to optimize the workflow, 
and this is good for them.

They have the makings of a leader. They are often able to set, albeit local, 
but specific goals, to achieve which there are all means. However, their 
requirements to the members of the group are accustomed to build in the 
absolute. Interaction with their subordinates takes place in the form of 
orders, which makes them seem rather harsh and merciless around. In view of 
this, from time to time a strong tension is created within the group.

If such a person does not pay enough attention to their development, then 
soon he will be crushed by the group. It is clear that in the presence of 
pressure, he will not be able to realize any of the goals. In order to 
become a strong personality, he should look for ways to change his behavior. 
You need to learn to most gently influence the other members of the group. 
It is also recommended that he adapt his own requirements to the needs of 
most of the team. Only when his personality is in a harmonious state can he 
determine the goals, find ways and means to achieve them.

Friends of such people, as a rule, a little. The reason for this lies in the 
fact that they do not go to the contact themselves. It is necessary that 
someone first suggested interacting together. At the same time, internally, 
they resist to close access to dozens of people.""",

than them.

They also prefer working with young people. They have experience and skills

interaction of such a person with the group, he still needs to at least 
sometimes forget about logic, and try to understand at a sensible level what 
is happening in society.

If this is not done, the words of such an individual at some point may 
become incomprehensible. Moreover, his ideas seem insane, and the members of 
the group will refuse to participate in their implementation. As a result, a 
person will turn out to be a rejected collective, although it will retain a 
sense of self-righteousness.

Such people have many friends. However, he can easily break with someone if 
he demands excessive attention or emotional empathy from him. In friendship 
for them the most important thing is the ability to come to the rescue, as 
well as the ability to jointly realize some ideas. They have a strong talent 
for drama and have the ability to teach. They know about this, and therefore 
often choose the appropriate profession.""",

when the 11th House in Pisces does not care much for his spiritual 
development, he can become a real parasite. He will use the members of his 
group to achieve their own goals, constantly spoil their mood.

acquired associates. However, such a person will learn to easily find 
profitable opportunities. In this case, they will certainly use them, even 
if as a result, someone will suffer damage.

But if he can find the strength for development, he will eventually learn 
how to render useful assistance in many cases, and also he can always 
mitigate difficult situations that arise in the team. However, regardless of 
the level of their development, such people will remain optimists. They will 
always look at the world, as if through rose-colored glasses. In very 
neglected cases, this can lead to tension and conflicts within the team.

constantly marred by unpleasant obstacles. Their main reason is excessive 
impulsiveness in their actions and inability to learn from their own 
erroneous actions. However, such a character warehouse has a positive 
quality. It consists in the persistent transfer of difficult moments of 
life, when it is not necessary to count on outside support.

This person is not recommended to spread about their plans to strangers. 
They need to be kept secret, gradually embodying into reality. He also has a 
pronounced manifestation of a feeling of empathy for the poor and sick, he 
has a desire to help those in need. However, a good intention quickly 
passes, and the thoughts of a person begin to spread to the concerns of 
everyday life.

Personality painfully experiences solitude, it needs constant communication 
with people. If there is no suitable environment, a person begins to show 
signs of depression, which in the course of time worsen. Interest in life 
may disappear and other unpleasant consequences may appear. At the same 
time, outbursts of enthusiasm are not properly perceived, the flow of energy 
is lost somewhere inside.

The spiritual development of such a person passes in the constant search for 
new ideas. He also seeks to focus the internal potential of the forces on 
the sacrifice of the victims. In this sacrifice often occurs in a state of 
psychological affect. Although this self-denial is sincere, it is often 
completely rash. Therefore, the individual must learn to contain emotional 
experiences.

A person who has 12 House in Aries never tries to understand his character. 
He prefers to act superficially, without interest, what happens in the 
spiritual treasury. However, if the person does not know himself, then there 
is likely to be a lack of consistency. Psychological problems will lead to 
nervousness, which will make conducting introspection simply unavoidable.

In his youth, such a person carefully monitors the condition of the body. 
This is highly advisable, since there is a chance of illness and accidents. 
Also, one needs to carefully choose professional activities. At the same 
time, the main criterion should be the absence of psychological stress, 
since any nervous tension affects the person with the 12th House in 
Aries.""",

"Taurus": """ A person who has a 12 house in Taurus is very prone to life’s 
dangers. This is due to a subconscious attraction to the accumulation of 
material wealth and the search for bodily pleasures. In the event of 
difficulties, he perceives them as the inevitability of fate, therefore he 
does not try to show resistance. Which leads to the emergence of even 
greater problems, in which small unsettled messes pour out.

Such a person often has an inferiority complex. This psychological problem 
prevents awareness of life goals. A person is sure that he is unable to take 
control of his own subconscious, so the decision-making depends on emotional 
experiences. If the character develops in a negative direction, it is likely 
that the reason for this was children’s memories obtained at an early age.

A person who has a 12 House in Taurus is predisposed to loneliness. He 
refers to this state with great seriousness, perceiving it as an integral 
part of life. This isolation prevents normal communication with people. 
Because of this aspect, a person can not fully empathize, express verbal 
compassion. If you want to help, offers only material assistance.

A person can fall into depressed states due to emotional experiences. At the 
same time, she tries to make a certain sacrifice in order to atone for the 
guilt. Such a victim sometimes requires money, thereby negatively affecting 
the material situation. Although as a result, the losses incurred are 
recovered fairly quickly, and life returns to its former course.

In professional activity such a person does not express special emotions, 
routinely fulfilling his duties. He should understand that any creative 
process is accompanied by oppression, but it is not a reason to fall into a 
depressed state. It is also necessary to reconsider the attitude towards the 
victims. In most cases, self-denial is unreasonable. Refusing personal 
benefits in favor of other people is appropriate only in rare life 
situations.

In a state of loneliness, a person tends to occupy himself with a difficult 
activity that allows him to concentrate on the thought process. He likes to 
look for unusual approaches to the usual cases, thereby showing ingenuity. 
In general, the person likes a solitary work that does not require the 
intervention of unauthorized persons. Otherwise, conflicts may arise that 
contribute to the already existing loneliness.

Such a person seeks to accumulate material wealth. For her, the availability 
of funds is a sign of security and confidence. At the slightest 
deterioration of the financial situation, various fears appear that prevent 
normal life. Man constantly tries to analyze the events taking place, 
including his own actions. In this case, there may be increased 
impulsiveness of character.

There is a need to resist life changes. The person prefers to suffer 
setbacks without trying to try a new solution to the problem that has 
arisen. There is a small naivete, due to the premature conclusions. Such 
inertia can bring negative consequences, representing a large financial loss 
— loss of cash or personal property.""",

"Gemini": """ If a person has 12 house in Gemini, this means increased 
intuitive ability to the integrity of the perception of the surrounding 
world. This aspect positively affects the psychological state, not allowing 
overload impressions. Personality easily handles new information, and this 
happens unconsciously. The necessary data appears in the head by itself, 
when the need arises in them.

Such a person tries not to expose emotional feelings. Secrecy is a goal for 
which personal efforts are used. He diligently hides his thoughts in the 
treasury of the soul, which is an advantage. This allows you to realize your 
life’s intentions without devoting your surroundings to them. There are no 
envious persons who are able to destroy plans at the most inopportune 
moment.

However, the above-described concealment also has some negative aspect. 
Personality is as if locked in an intellectual dungeon. She does not take 
part in the discussions and is distinguished by a lower level of 
communication skills. This prevents a full connection to the mental flow of 
the surrounding world. As a result of such isolation, strange concepts and 
philosophical ideas are formed in the person’s thoughts.

It is worth noting that the 12th House in Gemini promotes a sense of 
compassion towards the sick and disadvantaged. A person begins to engage in 
charity to satisfy light needs. He is able to find suitable words of 
consolation, spend considerable amounts of money for help. Such activities 
give the person a sincere self-gratification and a state of harmony with the 
external environment.

A person needs to be prepared for mental theft. His favorite thoughts are 
able to take over familiar people and use them without any references. This 
is not a cause for conflict, tolerance should be tolerated. Also, a person 
may have secret enemies, constantly building a variety of machinations. They 
are often characterized by an increased intelligence, and as a result, 
special care must be taken in communication.

Personality of the slope to sudden changes in mood. Sometimes emotional 
uplift can be replaced by a prolonged depression, depressing the nervous 
system. Such actions occur instinctively and are not controlled by the mind.

open. If this happens, it is recommended that efforts be made to develop the 
gift so that it will bring life’s benefits.

A person often has excellent intuition. When processing information, he uses 
the unique capabilities of the subconscious, resulting in the necessary data 
appear themselves. It is recommended to choose professional activities 
related to psychology. The study of this science is given to a person 
relatively simply. The result is significant prosperity, allowing you to

a cozy home, which will become a place of solitude and communication with 
loved ones. Personality pays great attention to spiritual development, 
constantly cultivating. It is most convenient for her to do introspection in 
a home environment where nothing is distracting.

Such a person seems insensitive to criticism. There is no negative reaction 
to negative judgments, however, this is only an illusion. In fact, he is 
deeply worried, inflicted insults and harbors insult. This happens in the 
depths of the soul, where outsiders are prohibited from entering. Such 
secrecy often leads to a violation of health, because all negative 
experiences do not go outside, literally eating away the psyche.

We can say that the person lives in a kind of emotional prison. In a loving 
relationship, it is not capable of fully revealing itself, and as a result, 
the testing of full-fledged feelings becomes impossible. In order to gain 
happiness, there is only one way, which is to offer one’s own independence 
as a sacrifice to family collectivism. Then it will be possible to create a 
warm home, which will become an exemplary example.

With a negative scenario of character development, a person begins to force 
people to donate to him. To achieve this goal, the lowest possible methods 
can be used, including deception and tying of various intrigues. Fighting 
such a shortcoming is difficult, because the individual lacks responsibility 
and honesty. A detailed self-analysis of actions is necessary, which in some 
cases brings a positive result.

With a positive development of character, a person who has a 12 House in 
Cancer is very emotional and inclined to self-sacrifice. He sympathizes with 
destitute and unfortunate people, often engaged in charity. This activity 
brings him true spiritual pleasure. Therefore, for him the most suitable

Outsiders are unable to break the will of such a person. However, he can 
fall under the yoke of his own selfishness and pride. His main opponent is

Personality falls into a depressed state when it is subjected to moral 
pressure, suggesting submission. In this scenario, the development scenario

In any case, a person feels that energy is escaping him. Therefore, in the 
professional activities of the individual, it is recommended to take the 
initiative into their own hands in order to avoid such problems.

If a person has 12 House in Leo, in life he is accompanied by loneliness. 
However, this is a positive aspect, which consists in creating original 
ideas. A person devotes himself entirely to his favorite activity and 
develops fundamentally new concepts of familiar things. However, at the 
slightest disturbance of loneliness, the spark of inspiration is 
extinguished, and as a result, the development of psychological oppression 
is likely.

The person expresses a strong empathy for the sick and disadvantaged people, 
often engaged in charity. It is incapable of accepting the imbalance of this 
world, and therefore leans toward the philosophy of nihilism, denying the 
existence of the Supreme Principle. With a negative scenario of character 
development, such a person sacrifices the interests of other people. It is 
important for him to achieve his own life goals, even in low ways.

A positive scenario of character development brings the opposite result. A 
person begins to sacrifice his own interests and even material benefits. 
This is accompanied by a desire for leadership and universal acceptance. In 
life, this aspect has negative consequences for the individual. However, in 
professional activities, in particular acting, helps to achieve significant 
achievements.

Also, a man with 12 House in Leo is well suited to activities hidden from 
prying eyes. This includes a variety of scientific research and the creation 
of cinematographic tapes. Such trades allow you to focus on the process

"Virgo": """ A person who has a 12 house in Virgo is very concerned. He has 
the disposition to exaggerate the importance of vital details, thereby 
causing bewilderment among the closest associates. And this happens on an 
intuitive level, the conscious mind is practically not involved. In some 
situations, such a remark of small things can be useful, but most often it 
interferes with life.

When a person is alone, she starts to put things in order in her own life, 
begins to pay great attention to various details, the importance of which 
has not been considered before. To leave the psychological dungeon, a person 
needs to understand his actions by conducting a detailed introspection. 
However, this requires a strong-willed effort to overcome its own laziness.

A positive scenario of character development gives the opportunity to create 
extraordinary ideas that help in professional activities. A person becomes a 
real inventor, able to solve a complex problem, which is an insurmountable 
obstacle for other people. He does this after understanding all aspects, 
penetrating into the depth of the matter. Which often leads to advancement 
on a career ladder and increase of monetary incomes.

In the negative scenario of development of character such a person is not 
inclined to disinterested help. When he acts as an act of charity, he tries 
by all means to gain a certain benefit for himself. And the latter need not 
be material goods. Personality is trying to achieve gratitude and human 
recognition. Only in this case does she receive satisfaction from charitable 
activities.

a variety of physiological procedures that are necessary for the successful 
cure of the disease. He is rather arrogant, constantly suspects a close 
environment in the tying of intrigues. At the same time, real enemies — 
hidden subconscious programs — often do not take into account.

When a person needs to sacrifice his own interests in favor of another 
person, she carefully thinks about this aspect. The process of sacrifice is 
difficult to give, because it is hampered by selfishness. Such a person is

A person is an introvert, so he feels well alone. When entering a society,
