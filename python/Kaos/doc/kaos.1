.SH OPERATIONS
.PP
Kaos has dozens of different functions and operations.
Not every function will be listed here, but below you will find a
description and usage for most of the basics.
.TP
\f[B]Anon\f[R]
Anon provides the basic functions required to both stay hidden as well
as cover your tracks after an operation.
Anon also provides a FakeID feature that provides the user with all
necessary information to create a new online identity including ssn,
dob, address, occupation, and even a working email address.
It should be noted however that the email address provided may not be
usable in all situations as some major sites have blocked the use of
temporary email accounts.
.TP
\f[B]RECON\f[R]
Recon, as you probably could have guessed, offers functions relating to
the reconnaissance part of your operations.
Recon has all of the basic functions needed like Whois, NMAP, Dig,
Nikto, theHarvester, an IP Locator and a few other things as well as one
specially designed program just for Kaos.
Stalker is a web crawler created to gather information from more than a
dozen online databases relating to your target.
Things that Stalker can find include but are not limited to, phone
numbers, addresses, associates, occupations, online accounts including
social media, and loads of other fun stuff that may have other wise
taken a few hours to find.
Stalker is provided as is and is in no way being represented as legal in
your area.
Please check your local laws before using this function.
All information provided by Stalker is available for free on the
internet and in no way hacks, bypasses, or attempts to illegally obtain
information in any unlawful way from any unwilling party.
The creator of this program is not a lawyer but does recommend
consulting with one before using this function in your operations.
\f[B]USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]REPORTING\f[R]
Reporting has been disabled in version 3.5.6 due to compatibility
issues.
This set of functions is planned to be reintegrated into Kaos in a later
version.
.TP
\f[B]WEBSITE CONTROL\f[R]
Website Control offers users the ability to save website pages in a
couple different ways.
More options will be added in later versions.
.TP
\f[B]NETWORK CONTROL\f[R]
Network Control has multiple functions to control as well as create new
networks.
All the basic network control functions expected can be found here.
.TP
\f[B]OFFENSE/DEFENSE\f[R]
Offense/Defense functions are more or less self explanatory.
They offer options for active offensive and defensive measures that may
or may not help the user.
Currently there are only a few functions but plans for more are in the
works for future releases.
These functions should be fully understood before use to avoid
irreversible damage to the users operating system.
\f[B]USE AT YOUR OWN RISK\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]MISC.\f[R]
Misc.
has various functions that don\[cq]t really fit into the other
categories.
These functions are things like a file checker, an os checker, service
status reports, user info, machine info and few other things.
These functions aren\[cq]t needed for the rest of the Kaos program but
may be helpful at times.
.TP
\f[B]G00G13\f[R]
G00G13 offers detailed information for Google hacking.
This section gives the user information about search keywords and ways
to find specific information very quickly.
This information is available through the Offensive Security website but
also offered here, in an unaffiliated way, for user convenience.
.TP
\f[B]914Y800K\f[R]
914Y800K is 73RM1N41\[cq]s personal playbook.
This is both incomplete and probably inaccurate and outdated but it has
been left here to be updated in the future.
Nothing in this section should be expected to work and may in fact cause
irreparable damage to the users operating system.
