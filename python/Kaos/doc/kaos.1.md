# NAME
 Kaos - Kali Automated Operations System

# SYNOPSIS
 **sudo python3 kaotic.py**

# DESCRIPTION
 **Kaos** is an automated system designed specifically for Kali Linux.  
 This system is still in active development and some functions may not
 work as expected. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

# OPERATIONS
 Kaos has dozens of different functions and operations. Not every function will be listed here, but below you will find a description and usage for most of the basics.    

 **Anon**  
 : Anon provides the basic functions required to both stay hidden as   well as cover your tracks after an operation. Anon also provides a FakeID feature that provides the user with all necessary information to create a new online identity including ssn, dob, address, occupation, and even a working email address. It should be noted however that the email address provided may not be usable in all situations as some major sites have blocked the use of temporary email accounts.    

 **RECON**  
 : Recon, as you probably could have guessed, offers functions relating to the reconnaissance part of your operations. Recon has all of the basic functions needed like Whois, NMAP, Dig, Nikto, theHarvester, an IP Locator and a few other things as well as one specially designed program just for Kaos.  Stalker is a web crawler created to gather information from more than a dozen online databases relating to your target. Things that Stalker can find include but are not limited to, phone numbers, addresses, associates, occupations, online accounts including social media, and loads of other fun stuff that may have other wise taken a few hours to find. Stalker is provided as is and is in no way being represented as legal in your area. Please check your local laws before using this function. All information provided by Stalker is available for free on the internet and in no way hacks, bypasses, or attempts to illegally obtain information in any unlawful way from any unwilling party. The creator of this program is not a lawyer but does recommend consulting with one before using this function in your operations. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  

 **REPORTING**  
 : Reporting has been disabled in version 3.5.6 due to compatibility issues. This set of functions is planned to be reintegrated into Kaos in a later version.  

 **WEBSITE CONTROL**  
 : Website Control offers users the ability to save website pages in a couple different ways. More options will be added in later versions.  

 **NETWORK CONTROL**  
 : Network Control has multiple functions to control as well as create new networks. All the basic network control functions expected can be found here.  

 **OFFENSE/DEFENSE**  
 : Offense/Defense functions are more or less self explanatory. They offer options for active offensive and defensive measures that may or may not help the user. Currently there are only a few functions but plans for more are in the works for future releases. These functions should be fully understood before use to avoid irreversible damage to the users operating system. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**  

 **MISC.**  
 : Misc. has various functions that don't really fit into the other categories. These functions are things like a file checker, an os checker, service status reports, user info, machine info and few other things. These functions aren't needed for the rest of the Kaos program but may be helpful at times.  

 **G00G13**  
 : G00G13 offers detailed information for Google hacking. This section gives the user information about search keywords and ways to find specific information very quickly. This information is available through the Offensive Security website but also offered here, in an unaffiliated way, for user convenience.  

 **914Y800K**  
 : 914Y800K is 73RM1N41's personal playbook. This is both incomplete and probably inaccurate and outdated but it has been left here to be updated in the future. Nothing in this section should be expected to work and may in fact cause irreparable damage to the users operating system. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**
